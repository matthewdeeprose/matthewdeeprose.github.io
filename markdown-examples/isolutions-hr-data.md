### Junior Levels (1b-3)

- **Female**: 24 → 18 (-6 staff, -25.0% decrease)
- **Male**: 54 → 42 (-12 staff, -22.2% decrease)
- **Total**: 78 → 60 (-18 staff, -23.1% decrease)

### Senior Levels (4-5)

- **Female**: 37 → 74 (+37 staff, +100.0% increase)

## Notable Patterns

1. **Inverted Hierarchy**: Interestingly, junior levels consistently show higher female representation than senior levels until 2022/23, when this pattern reversed.

2. **Senior Level Breakthrough**: The most significant progress occurred in senior levels (4-5), where female representation increased from 21.3% to 33.6%.

3. **Leadership Volatility**: Leadership representation fluctuates due to small absolute numbers, making percentage changes appear dramatic.

4. **Organisational Restructuring**: The significant changes in staff numbers suggest departmental restructuring, with junior positions being reduced whilst senior and leadership positions expanded.

5. **Female Growth Concentration**: The majority of female staff growth occurred in senior positions, suggesting successful progression and recruitment at higher levels.

## Conclusions

- **Senior levels** show the most encouraging progress with substantial improvement in female representation
- **Junior levels** maintain relatively stable representation but with concerning overall staff reductions
- **Leadership levels** show gradual improvement but remain the most underrepresented
- The data suggests a "middle-heavy" structure emerging, with growth concentrated in levels 4-5

# Gender Equality Analysis: Recruitment Data Commentary

## Summary of Findings

The recruitment data from 2019/20 to 2023/24 reveals a **paradoxical pattern**: whilst women apply in significantly lower numbers, they consistently achieve higher success rates at every stage of the recruitment process. This suggests the department's selection processes are not disadvantaging women, but there may be barriers preventing women from applying in the first place.

## Key Statistical Evidence

### Overall Participation and Success Rates

| Metric           | Female | Male  | Total | Female % |
| ---------------- | ------ | ----- | ----- | -------- |
| **Applications** | 666    | 1,559 | 2,225 | 29.9%    |
| **Shortlisted**  | 233    | 461   | 694   | 33.6%    |
| **Offered**      | 80     | 136   | 216   | 37.0%    |
| **Appointed**    | 76     | 120   | 196   | 38.8%    |
| **Success Rate** | 11.4%  | 7.7%  | 8.8%  | +3.7pp   |

**Key Finding**: Women represent only 29.9% of applications but achieve 38.8% of appointments, demonstrating higher success rates throughout the process.

### Key Patterns by Seniority

**Junior Levels (1b, 2a, 2b, 3)**:

- Mixed results with some male advantages at entry levels
- Level 2a shows strong female representation (77.1%) and success
- Level 1b has very low female application rate (5.8%)
- Level 3 shows strong female advantage (+5.1 percentage points)

**Senior Positions (4, 5)**:

- Consistent female advantages ranging from 3.6 to 3.8 percentage points
- Female application rates between 28.9% and 37.7%
- Strong female performance at both levels

**Leadership Level (7)**:

- Largest gender gap favouring women (+10.2 percentage points)
- Good female representation in applications (31.9%)
- Strong evidence against "glass ceiling" effects
- Note: No Level 6 positions in the dataset

## Interpretation and Implications

### Positive Indicators

1. **No systemic discrimination**: The consistently higher female success rates indicate the selection process is fair and possibly even favours qualified female candidates
2. **Quality of female applicants**: Higher success rates suggest female applicants may be better qualified or better prepared when they do apply
3. **Leadership-level success**: Strong female performance at Level 7 suggests no "glass ceiling" effect in the recruitment process

### Areas of Concern

1. **Application barriers**: Women represent only 29.9% of applicants despite 50%+ of the general population
2. **Grade-specific patterns**: Some junior levels (1b, 2b) show male advantages, suggesting potential issues with entry-level attraction
3. **Potential self-selection**: Women may only apply when highly confident of success, indicating possible psychological or systemic barriers

### Recommendations for Further Investigation

1. **Application process review**: Examine job advertisements, application requirements, and recruitment channels to identify potential barriers to female applications
2. **Workplace culture analysis**: Investigate whether workplace culture, flexible working policies, or career development opportunities might discourage female applications
3. **Grade 1b and 2b focus**: Specifically examine why these entry-level positions show male advantages despite overall patterns
4. **2023/24 anomaly**: Investigate what changed in the most recent year to cause the shift in success rates

### Calculation Methodology

All percentages and gaps in this analysis are calculated as follows:

- **Success Rate** = (Appointments ÷ Applications) × 100
- **Gender Gap** = Female Rate - Male Rate (positive = female advantage)
- **Stage Conversion** = (Next Stage ÷ Current Stage) × 100
- **Percentage Points (pp)** = Direct subtraction of percentages (not ratio)

**Data Source**: Recruitment CSV covering academic years 2019/20 through 2023/24, analysed using statistical aggregation across all grades and years.

The data suggests your department's recruitment selection processes are working well for gender equality - arguably even favouring female candidates. The primary challenge appears to be encouraging more women to apply in the first place. This indicates the focus should be on:

- Removing barriers to application
- Improving outreach to female candidates
- Addressing any workplace factors that might discourage female interest
- Maintaining the current fair selection processes that are working effectively

The pattern suggests high-quality female candidates are succeeding when they apply, but systemic factors may be preventing more women from applying initially.
