00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:06.166


00:00:06.166 --> 00:00:10.332
[Dr Tharindu Liyanagunawardena] Thank you.
I think first of all, we have to raise awareness of

00:00:10.333 --> 00:00:14.499
digital accessibility and the
techniques that staff can use in

00:00:14.500 --> 00:00:18.600
creating accessible content. Our
colleagues could be the world

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:22.600
experts in their field of study,
but they may not be aware of

00:00:22.600 --> 00:00:26.100
digital accessibility, so
awareness is so important.

00:00:26.100 --> 00:00:27.000


00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:30.933
It is also important to show
that digital accessibility is

00:00:30.933 --> 00:00:34.966
not an abstract concept. It's
not something out there. It's

00:00:34.966 --> 00:00:38.832
very tangible and essential for
users. So I generally use

00:00:38.833 --> 00:00:40.633
anecdotes and user stories.

00:00:40.633 --> 00:00:43.533


00:00:43.533 --> 00:00:47.399
The next thing I would say is
use the same language as the staff.

00:00:47.400 --> 00:00:47.866


00:00:47.866 --> 00:00:50.666
So use examples that are
relevant to them.

00:00:50.666 --> 00:00:51.832


00:00:51.833 --> 00:00:56.166
I generally collect examples
of inaccessible content as well

00:00:56.166 --> 00:01:00.399
as good content from all over
the university and I try to use

00:01:00.400 --> 00:01:04.633
something relevant to them so
that they can make a connection

00:01:04.633 --> 00:01:06.299


00:01:06.300 --> 00:01:09.966
to what I'm talking about.

00:01:09.966 --> 00:01:10.766


00:01:10.766 --> 00:01:15.966
Again I would say another
thing that would be that I use

00:01:15.966 --> 00:01:21.232
is making life easier for staff
by creating content by giving

00:01:21.233 --> 00:01:24.633
accessible templates and helpful
tools.

00:01:24.633 --> 00:01:25.633


00:01:25.633 --> 00:01:29.399
Most of all, most importantly be
there for them when they start

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:33.000
their accessibility journey.
They will need help and support

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:36.566
and make sure that they know
that there is support available

00:01:36.566 --> 00:01:37.566
to them.

00:01:37.566 --> 00:01:40.732


00:01:40.733 --> 00:01:44.133
[Lara Tompkins] Thank you Tharindu . I love
especially your example about

00:01:44.133 --> 00:01:48.066
using story and narrative to get
buy-in from your staff.

00:01:48.066 --> 00:01:49.066
That's beautiful.

00:01:49.066 --> 00:01:49.699


00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:53.466
Sarah. What about you? How do
you engage your staff in creating accessible content?

00:01:53.466 --> 00:01:57.066
[Sarah Whittaker] Yeah, for our staff, we
have a plethora of training actually.

00:01:57.066 --> 00:02:00.932
So my job is basically
looking after the professional

00:02:00.933 --> 00:02:03.899
development for our 1200
faculty. And we we have

00:02:03.900 --> 00:02:07.700
accessibility training, but we
actually embedded in all of our

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:11.500
courses. So for example, we have
mandatory courses. So I could

00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:15.433
have, I could have answered yes
to that last question. We have

00:02:15.433 --> 00:02:18.566
mandatory courses that all
faculty have to take for

00:02:18.566 --> 00:02:19.932
Blackboard for example.

00:02:19.933 --> 00:02:20.066


00:02:20.066 --> 00:02:23.732
And within that we showcase
not just the accessibility

00:02:23.733 --> 00:02:27.699
features but "the why" you want to
do this. So why you want to add

00:02:27.700 --> 00:02:31.466
an alternative description to
the image. So, as we're teaching

00:02:31.466 --> 00:02:34.932
them to add an image into
Blackboard, we teach them about

00:02:34.933 --> 00:02:38.666
alternative descriptions and why
you should add them. We also

00:02:38.666 --> 00:02:42.666
teach them things like simple
Microsoft Word training.

00:02:42.666 --> 00:02:46.199
We tell them the importance of
having having headers and sub

00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:49.666
headers and not just trying to
create those on your own.

00:02:49.666 --> 00:02:50.266


00:02:50.266 --> 00:02:53.499
We also include in our
instructional design practise

00:02:53.500 --> 00:02:56.866
a contrast colour contrast checker.
When we're looking at our

00:02:56.866 --> 00:03:00.799
Blackboard and we're now doing a
little bit of a transition over

00:03:00.800 --> 00:03:04.400
to Learn Ultra. So in those
trainings we're showcasing how

00:03:04.400 --> 00:03:08.133
Learn Ultra is a bit more
forcing you to be accessible.

00:03:08.133 --> 00:03:11.666
You know, because it's more
black and white, it's minimal

00:03:11.666 --> 00:03:15.399
colours, it's easy to navigate
through where original you can

00:03:15.400 --> 00:03:19.233
get a little bit crazy and you
can, you know, the faculty have

00:03:19.233 --> 00:03:20.299
a lot more room to

00:03:20.300 --> 00:03:20.566


00:03:20.566 --> 00:03:23.932
mess it up, let's just say
politely. So we show them the

00:03:23.933 --> 00:03:27.433
difference and why you want to
take those practises to the

00:03:27.433 --> 00:03:31.233
faculty that are still using the
original LMS system. That, OK,

00:03:31.233 --> 00:03:34.699
let's look at black and white.
Let's make sure that you're

00:03:34.700 --> 00:03:38.200
using the headers and the
subtitles there as well, because

00:03:38.200 --> 00:03:41.466
if you have a student who's
using, you know, a reader,

00:03:41.466 --> 00:03:44.899
they're going to need that
support so not to disadvantage

00:03:44.900 --> 00:03:48.033
your students. So we try to
embed it into all of the

00:03:48.033 --> 00:03:50.433
professional development that we
provide.

00:03:50.433 --> 00:03:50.699


00:03:50.700 --> 00:03:50.733
And then as well we we do
flyers, we do, you know, tips,

00:03:50.733 --> 00:03:57.599
we have a lot of EdTech tips
that we send out, we send out on

00:03:57.600 --> 00:04:01.000
a weekly basis and we embed it
[accessibility] into those tips as well.

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:05.733


00:04:05.733 --> 00:04:09.199
[Lara Tompkins] Thank you Sarah.
Yeah, I love that both of you are really

00:04:09.200 --> 00:04:12.933
honing in on using visualisation
as a tool to really drive it

00:04:12.933 --> 00:04:16.833
home to your staff and get them
invested. One more question, and

00:04:16.833 --> 00:04:17.833
that is

00:04:17.833 --> 00:04:17.966


00:04:17.966 --> 00:04:21.432
for Esin and Terry. Do you have
any tips for countering

00:04:21.433 --> 00:04:25.166
arguments like "I don't
have any disabled students" and

00:04:25.166 --> 00:04:26.666
"I don't have time for this"?

00:04:26.666 --> 00:04:27.699


00:04:27.700 --> 00:04:28.900
Again, we'll start with Esin.

00:04:28.900 --> 00:04:30.000


00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:34.166
[Dr Esin Caglayan] Yeah, sure. For the
question, but "I don't have any

00:04:34.166 --> 00:04:38.732
disabled students". My counter
argument would be you may not be

00:04:38.733 --> 00:04:39.733
sure of that.

00:04:39.733 --> 00:04:40.399


00:04:40.400 --> 00:04:44.600
There may be students with
certain disabilities like

00:04:44.600 --> 00:04:49.033
dyslexia which they themselves
are not aware of. Also there

00:04:49.033 --> 00:04:53.599
are some students who hesitate
to submit an official report to

00:04:53.600 --> 00:04:58.066
their instructors or to their
faculty, or share anything about

00:04:58.066 --> 00:05:02.066
their disabilities. So we may
not be sure of you know,

00:05:02.066 --> 00:05:05.799
different learning styles,
different preferences or

00:05:05.800 --> 00:05:10.100
disabilities. That's why as
instructors, we should take the

00:05:10.100 --> 00:05:10.666
lead and

00:05:10.666 --> 00:05:10.766


00:05:10.766 --> 00:05:14.566
what we do is we just empower
instructors through training

00:05:14.566 --> 00:05:18.232
programmes. I created an in
house twelve module professional

00:05:18.233 --> 00:05:22.099
development course for our
instructors and one of the

00:05:22.100 --> 00:05:26.066
modules is only for preparing
digitally accessible materials.

00:05:26.066 --> 00:05:26.932


00:05:26.933 --> 00:05:30.499
And another module is about
alternative assessments

00:05:30.500 --> 00:05:33.900
actually, which aims to
encourage instructors to

00:05:33.900 --> 00:05:38.033
incorporate various types of
assessments, not only tests or

00:05:38.033 --> 00:05:42.133
written assignment submissions
but other options which are

00:05:42.133 --> 00:05:46.066
available through multimedia as
well. And we also have a

00:05:46.066 --> 00:05:50.132
community of practise activity,
which we called TLCoP,

00:05:50.133 --> 00:05:54.333
Community of Practise. And we
encourage instructors to share

00:05:54.333 --> 00:05:57.566
their good practises. You know,
peer learning

00:05:57.566 --> 00:05:57.699


00:05:57.700 --> 00:06:00.933
is sometimes more
influential.

00:06:00.933 --> 00:06:02.166


00:06:02.166 --> 00:06:06.432
Recently one of our instructors,
for example from the engineering

00:06:06.433 --> 00:06:10.233
faculty shared an application
which she developed herself.

00:06:10.233 --> 00:06:11.833


00:06:11.833 --> 00:06:16.133
This application aims to
turn a PDF, a static PDF

00:06:16.133 --> 00:06:20.299
document, into an animated
PowerPoint presentation. And

00:06:20.300 --> 00:06:24.833
this was a particularly useful
for online sessions where the

00:06:24.833 --> 00:06:29.566
instructor is screen sharing you
know the whole PDF rather than

00:06:29.566 --> 00:06:33.966
doing that you know, practically
preparing your PowerPoint

00:06:33.966 --> 00:06:38.032
presentation with animations.
That has been found very

00:06:38.033 --> 00:06:41.666
practical and welcomed by the
other instructors.

00:06:41.666 --> 00:06:42.466


00:06:42.466 --> 00:06:46.799
Also we prepare templates...
I mean digitally

00:06:46.800 --> 00:06:51.533
accessible templates for our
instructors, ready made, just as

00:06:51.533 --> 00:06:56.166
a counter argument for "I don't
have time for this". So these

00:06:56.166 --> 00:07:00.032
templates are for course
syllabi, some assessment

00:07:00.033 --> 00:07:04.599
instructions. You know,
those kinds of templates that

00:07:04.600 --> 00:07:08.966
can be used across various
faculties or courses. So the

00:07:08.966 --> 00:07:12.966
instructors themselves just
customise and use them

00:07:12.966 --> 00:07:15.232
in their own courses as they
wish.

00:07:15.233 --> 00:07:16.566


00:07:16.566 --> 00:07:17.566
Thank you.

00:07:17.566 --> 00:07:19.166


00:07:19.166 --> 00:07:20.166
Thank you Esin.

00:07:20.166 --> 00:07:20.699


00:07:20.700 --> 00:07:21.700
And Terry.

00:07:21.700 --> 00:07:22.200


00:07:22.200 --> 00:07:24.566
What about you? What tips do you
have for counting these types of

00:07:24.566 --> 00:07:25.566
arguments?

00:07:25.566 --> 00:07:26.332


00:07:26.333 --> 00:07:31.599
[Terry Green] OK, so in Ontario there's the
this thing called the AODA Act,

00:07:31.600 --> 00:07:36.933
the Accessibility for Ontarians
with Disabilities Act and its

00:07:36.933 --> 00:07:38.199
goal is to make

00:07:38.200 --> 00:07:38.866


00:07:38.866 --> 00:07:43.099
accessibility widespread and
commonplace. And you must be in

00:07:43.100 --> 00:07:46.833
compliance. It has some
principles, the principles of

00:07:46.833 --> 00:07:49.966
dignity, independence,
integration and equal

00:07:49.966 --> 00:07:52.666
opportunity. So if someone said
to me,

00:07:52.666 --> 00:07:53.932


00:07:53.933 --> 00:07:57.233
"but I don't have any disabled students
and I don't have any time for this",

00:07:57.233 --> 00:08:00.566
I can say, "Tough luck, pal. It's
the law and you have to do it".

00:08:00.566 --> 00:08:03.366
So, it's kind of a no brainer
for us here in Ontario.
