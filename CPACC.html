    <p>March 2020</p>
    <h1><span>1. </span>The Purpose of this Document</h1>
    <p>This Body of Knowledge document outlines the knowledge and skills expected of can<span></span>didates seeking to obtain the Certified Professional in Accessibility Core Competencies (CPACC) credential. Specifically, the three main purposes of this document are to:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>List the categories of information covered in the exam</li>
      <li>Present general information about each category</li>
      <li>Recommend study tasks</li>
      <li>Provide links to resources on each topic</li>
    </ul>
    <p>The Body of Knowledge is an open resource that is designed to be a starting point when studying for the CPACC exam. It presents concepts, theories and other information that should be mastered to indicate possession of core competencies expected of accessi<span></span>bility professionals. The Body of Knowledge is also designed to help candidates prepare for the exam and provides references to resources for additional learning and explora<span></span>tion. However, it does not provide an exhaustive explanation of every concept or ques<span></span>tion on the exam; its use does not guarantee candidate success.</p>
    <p>The web is a dynamic place, and so we cannot guarantee that all links will continue to work. If you discover any broken links, please alert us by sending an email to <a href="mailto:certification%40accessibilityassociation.org?subject=IAAP%20CPACC%20BOK%20Broken%20Links" lang="en-US">Certification committee email address</a></p>
    <h1><span>2. </span>IAAP Exam Preparation Resources</h1>
    <p>Prospective test-takers are welcome to prepare for the exam by studying high quali<span></span>ty materials available from reputable sources. IAAP lists a collection of both free and for-purchase CPACC preparation resources on the <a href="https://www.accessibilityassociation.org/exampreparation" lang="en-US">IAAP Exam preparation page</a> page. Please be aware that a preparation course alone cannot guarantee success on the exam. Along with the Body of Knowledge, candidates should review the <a href="https://www.accessibilityassociation.org/content.asp?admin=Y&amp;contentid=340" lang="en-US">CPACC Certification Content Outline</a> to determine where they should spend their time studying information that is new or not fully familiar to them. </p>
    <p>The IAAP also maintains a list of approved exam preparation providers on the <a href="https://www.accessibilityassociation.org/certificationproviders" lang="en-US">Approved Certification Preparation Providers listed on the IAAP website</a> page.</p>
    <h1><span>3. </span>About the CPACC Credential</h1>
    <p>The Certified Professional in Accessibility Core Competencies credential is IAAP’s foun<span></span>dational certification, representing the practical application of broad, cross-disciplinary conceptual knowledge about 1) disabilities, 2) accessibility and universal design, and 3) accessibility-related standards, laws, and management strategies. Relevant domains for the CPACC credential include:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>The web and other information communication technologies (ICT)</li>
      <li>Architecture and the built environment</li>
      <li>Consumers and industrial design</li>
      <li>Transportation systems, and</li>
      <li>Any domain in which thoughtful design, policy, and management can improve disability access.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>The CPACC can be considered the baseline IAAP credential for both non-technical and technical accessibility roles. For those who do work at the technical level, IAAP also of<span></span>fers the Web Accessibility Specialist (WAS) credential. Individuals who pass the CPACC and WAS exams carry a higher-level credential called the Certified Professional in Web Accessibility (CPWA). The IAAP has plans to grow domain specific designation offerings and will announce when those additional certification exams are available to the public.</p>

    <h2><span>4.1. </span>Theoretical Models of Disability</h2>
    <h3>Recommended Study Tasks</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Identify prominent theoretical models of disability.</li>
      <li>Describe their basic concepts, and understand their strengths and weaknesses.</li>
      <li>Identify which models align most closely with the principles of accessibility and universal design.</li>
      <li>Apply the models to example scenarios in the lives of people with disabilities.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Overview</h3>
    <p>Theoretical models of disability provide perspectives and frameworks through which to understand disability. No model is comprehensive, so can be neither fully correct nor incorrect. Each has strengths as well as limitations. In practice, organizations generally make use of aspects of multiple models, in particular the social and medical models.</p>

    <h3><span>4.1.1. </span>Medical Model</h3>
    <h4>Definitions</h4>
    <p>From Disabled World: “The medical model is presented as viewing disability as a problem of the person, directly caused by disease, trauma, or other health condition which therefore requires sustained medical care provided in the form of individual treatment by professionals. In the medical model, management of the disability is aimed at a ‘cure,’ or the individual’s adjustment and behavioral change that would lead to an ‘almost-cure’ or effective cure. In the medical model, medical care is viewed as the main issue, and at the political level, the principal response is that of modifying or reforming health care policy.”</p>
    <p>From the US National Institutes of Health: “One result of the common medical understanding of disability is that people with disabilities often report feeling excluded, undervalued, pressured to fit a questionable norm, and / or treated as if they were globally incapacitated. People with disabilities often express frustration when they are met with pitying attitudes or incredulity if they speak about anything positive related to living with their conditions.”</p>
    <p>From the University of Leicester, UK: “The medical model of disability views disability as a ‘problem’ that belongs to the disabled individual. It is not seen as an issue to concern anyone other than the individual affected. For example, if a wheelchair-using student is unable to get into a building because of some steps, the medical model would suggest that this is because of the wheelchair, rather than the steps.</p>
    <h4>Strengths</h4>
    <p>The medical model can address the biological sources of disabilities, either by clinically curing them or providing ways to medically manage the conditions. The medical compo<span></span>nent of disabilities is a critical reality for many people.</p>
    <h4>Weaknesses</h4>
    <p>The medical model treats disability as a problem or inherent characteristic of the indi<span></span>vidual and seeks a cure or medical management of a bodily condition, often overlooking the broader sociopolitical constraints imposed by unwelcoming or inaccessible environ<span></span>ments.</p>
    <h3><span>4.1.2. </span>Social Model</h3>
    <h4>Definitions</h4>
    <p>From Disabled World: “The social model of disability sees the issue of ‘disability’ as a socially created problem and a matter of the full integration of individuals into society. In this model, disability is not an attribute of an individual, but rather a complex collection of conditions, many of which are created by the social environment. Hence, the management of the problem requires social action and is the collective responsibility of society at large to make the environmental modifications necessary for the full participation of people with disabilities in all areas of social life. The issue is both cultural and ideological, requiring individual, community, and large-scale social change. From this perspective, equal access for someone with an impairment / disability is a human rights issue of major concern.”</p>
    <p>From the University of Leicester, UK: “This model draws on the idea that it is society that disables people, through designing everything to meet the needs of the majority of people who are not disabled. There is a recognition within the social model that there is a great deal that society can do to reduce, and ultimately remove, some of these disabling barriers, and that this task is the responsibility of society, rather than the disabled person. The social model is more inclusive in approach, as pro-active thought is given to how disabled people can participate in activities on an equal footing with non-disabled people. Certain adjustments are made, even where this involves time or money, to ensure that disabled people are not excluded. The onus is on the organiser of the event or activity to make sure that their activity is accessible. Examples might be:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>course leader who meets with a visually impaired member of the group before the beginning of a course to find out how hand-outs can be adapted so that the student can read them;</li>
      <li>member of staff who makes PowerPoint presentations available on Blackboard to all members of the group before a lecture. This allows dyslexic students to look up unfamiliar terminology before the lecture and gives them an idea of the structure that will be followed. This ‘framing’ helps students to understand and retain the information;</li>
      <li>Students’ Union society that consults with disabled members before organising an event in order to make sure that the venue is accessible.”</li>
    </ul>
    <p>For disability advocates the social model of disability has become a rallying cry for so<span></span>cial justice.</p>
    <h4>Strengths</h4>
    <p>The social model’s focus on the disabling conditions in the environment and in society makes it clear that the barriers and challenges experienced by people with disabilities are not inevitable, nor are they exclusively a characteristic of the individual’s “broken” body. Societies can improve the lives of people with disabilities considerably by ensur<span></span>ing that the world is designed to accommodate a wide range of human characteristics and abilities.</p>
    <h4>Weaknesses</h4>
    <p>The social model of disability can tend to downplay the embodied aspects of disabilities too much, as if disability had nothing to do with bodily characteristics at all. The social model’s push for social justice in the political arena can also put activists at odds with people with other political interests, antagonizing relationships and sometimes creating resolute political adversaries.</p>
    <h3><span>4.1.3. </span>Biopsychosocial Model</h3>
    <h4>Definition</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>2002, the World Health Organization published the International Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health, which describes the complex phenomenon of disabil<span></span>ity and integrates the social and medical models:</li>
      <li>better model of disability, in short, is one that synthesizes what is true in the medical and social models, without making the mistake each makes in reducing the whole, complex notion of disability to one of its aspects. This more useful model of disability might be called the biopsychosocial model. ICF is based on this model, an integration of medical and social. ICF provides, by this synthesis, a coherent view of different perspectives of health: biological, individual and social.”</li>
    </ul>
    <h3><span>4.1.4. </span>Economic Model</h3>
    <h4>Definition</h4>
    <p>From Disabled World: “The economic model of disability defines disability by a person’s inability to participate in work. It also assesses the degree to which impairment affects an individual’s productivity and the economic consequences for the individual, employer and the state. Such consequences include loss of earnings for and payment for assis<span></span>tance by the individual; lower profit margins for the employer; and state welfare pay<span></span>ments. This model is directly related to the charity model.”</p>
    <h4>Strengths</h4>
    <p>The economic model recognizes the effect of bodily limitations on a person’s ability to work, and there may be a need for economic support and / or accommodations for the person’s disability.</p>
    <h4>Weaknesses</h4>
    <p>The economic model creates a legally defined category of people who are needy, which can be stigmatizing for people with disabilities. Also, if a person doesn’t meet the legal threshold for disabled, or if there is a dispute as to a person’s disability, the person with the disability may not receive the support they need.</p>
    <h3><span>4.1.5. </span>Functional Solutions Model</h3>
    <h4>Definition</h4>
    <p>The functional solutions model of disability is a practical perspective that identifies the limitations (or “functional impairments”) due to disability, with the intent to create and promote solutions to overcome those limitations. The primary task is to eliminate, or at least reduce, the impact of the functional limitations of the body through technological or methodological innovation. The pragmatism of the functional solution model deempha<span></span>sizes the sociopolitical aspects of disability, and instead prioritizes inventiveness and entrepreneurship.</p>
    <h4>Strengths</h4>
    <p>The strongest aspect of this model is that it is results-oriented. It seeks to provide solu<span></span>tions to real-world challenges, while sidestepping the often-convoluted sociopolitical implications of disability within society.</p>
    <h4>Weaknesses</h4>
    <p>When new technologies are involved, profit-driven entrepreneurs can sometimes miss the mark, creating products that may be innovative but not practical or useful, or which may be of more benefit to the innovators than to the target population, especially if the proposed solutions are expensive. Also, when the primary cause of a particular chal<span></span>lenge is the socioeconomic circumstances in the environment, the functional solutions model’s de-emphasis on socioeconomic issues can cause would-be innovators to ig<span></span>nore the most important aspects of the original problem.</p>
    <h3><span>4.1.6. </span>Social Identity or Cultural Affiliation Model</h3>
    <h4>Definition</h4>
    <p>The social identity or cultural affiliation model refers to a sense of deriving one’s per<span></span>sonal identity from membership within a group of like-minded individuals. This model is most evident among people who are deaf, because of their shared linguistic expe<span></span>rience as sign language users. For example, Deaf culture and identity owes much of its strength to the somewhat exclusive nature of being a part of a close-knit linguistic minority.</p>
    <p>Other people with disabilities may also feel a sense of belonging to a community with common life experiences and interests.</p>
    <h4>Strengths</h4>
    <p>The social identity or cultural affiliation model accepts the person’s disability completely and uses it as a point of pride in being associated with other people in a similar condi<span></span>tion.</p>
    <h4>Weaknesses</h4>
    <p>The sense of belonging felt by one group of people can be counterbalanced by a feeling of exclusion by people who don’t fit the group’s expectations.</p>
    <h3><span>4.1.7. </span> Charity Model</h3>
    <h4>Definition</h4>
    <p>The charity model regards people with disabilities as unfortunate and in need of assis<span></span>tance from the outside, with those providing charity viewed as benevolent contributors to a needy population.</p>
    <h4>Strengths</h4>
    <p>The charity model can inspire people to contribute their time and / or resources to pro<span></span>vide assistance when it is genuinely needed.</p>
    <h4>Weaknesses</h4>
    <p>The charity model can be condescending toward people with disabilities, who may come to resent the feeling that they are the object of pity by other people, and that they must depend on accepting or cultivating this pity on a continual basis. The charity model often focuses on short-term, immediate needs, often at the expense of more comprehensive, and ultimately more effective, long-term solutions.</p>

    <h3><span>4.2.1. </span>Visual Disabilities</h3>
    <h4>Overview</h4>
    <p>Visual disabilities are sensory disabilities that can range from some amount of vision loss, loss of visual acuity, or increased or decreased sensitivity to specific or bright col<span></span>ors, to complete or uncorrectable loss of vision in either or both eyes. </p>
    <h4>Blindness</h4>
    <p>Definition: Blindness is involving nearly complete vision loss.</p>
    <p>Characteristics: Some people are completely blind, without the ability to see anything. Others can perceive light versus dark, or the general shapes of large objects, but cannot read text or recognize people by sight.</p>
    <p>Demographics: As reported by the World Health Organization Fact Sheet: Vision Impairment and Blindness: </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Globally, at least 2.2 billion people have a vision impairment or blindness, of whom at least 1 billion have a vision impairment that could have been prevented or has yet to be addressed.</li>
      <li>The 1 billion people with vision impairment includes those with moderate or se<span></span>vere distance vision impairment or blindness due to unaddressed refractive error, as well as near vision impairment caused by unaddressed presbyopia.</li>
      <li>Globally, the leading causes of vision impairment are uncorrected refractive er<span></span>rors and cataracts.</li>
      <li>The majority of people with vision impairment are over 50 years of age. </li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Color Blindness</h4>
    <p>Definition: Color blindness is a sensory disability that impairs a person’s ability to distinguish certain color combinations.</p>
    <p>Characteristics: The most common forms of color-blindness affect an individual’s ability to distinguish reds and greens, although other colors may be affected.</p>
    <p>Demographics: According to the US National Institutes of Health, US National Library of Medicine, Genetics Home Reference article, Color Vision Deficiency:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Red-green color vision defects are the most common form of color vision defi<span></span>ciency. This condition affects males much more often than females. Among popu<span></span>lations with Northern European ancestry, it occurs in about 1 in 12 males and 1 in 200 females. Red-green color vision defects have a lower incidence in almost all other populations studied.</li>
      <li>Blue-yellow color vision defects affect males and females equally. This condition occurs in fewer than 1 in 10,000 people worldwide.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Blue cone monochromacy is rarer than the other forms of color vision deficiency, affect<span></span>ing about 1 in 100,000 people worldwide. Like red-green color vision defects, blue cone monochromacy affects males much more often than females. </p>
    <h4>Low Vision</h4>
    <p>Definition: The American Federation for the Blind offers a functional definition:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Low vision is uncorrectable vision loss that interferes with daily activities. It is better defined in terms of function, rather than numerical test results.</li>
      <li>other words, low vision is “not enough vision to do whatever it is you need to do,” which can vary from person to person.</li>
      <li>Most eye care professionals prefer to use the term “low vision” to describe per<span></span>manently reduced vision that cannot be corrected with regular glasses, contact lenses, medicine, or surgery.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Characteristics: A person with low vision will typically need magnification to see well enough to read or discern other details. Some people with low vision experience low contrast, and therefore benefit from high contrast text and graphics. Some experience color deficiencies, which means they may not be able to see the difference between certain colors.</p>
    <p>Demographics: According to the World Health Organization, about 246 million people, or 3.5% of the world’s population, have low vision. About 90% of people with vision impairments live in low income settings.</p>

    <h3><span>4.2.2. </span>Auditory Disabilities</h3>
    <h4>Overview</h4>
    <p>Auditory disabilities are sensory disabilities that range from partial to complete hearing loss.</p>
    <h4>Deafness</h4>
    <p>Definition: Deafness is the total or near total loss of hearing. </p>
    <p>Characteristics: A person who is deaf or hard of hearing has difficulty with sounds, including the audio component of multimedia materials. Many, but not all, people who are deaf know sign language. Often sign language is the first language — and therefore the most comfortable native language — of those who are born deaf. They may feel less comfortable reading printed or digital text because it is a foreign language for them, and the phonetic notation does not help their comprehension. By way of contrast, those who lose their hearing later in life may never learn sign language, or if they learn it, they may not feel as comfortable speaking in sign, and may prefer text.</p>
    <h4>Hard of Hearing</h4>
    <p>Definition: Hard of hearing (HOH) refers to people with hearing loss ranging from mild to severe, who still have some useful hearing, and may communicate through sign language, spoken language, or both understand spoken language in some situations, with or without amplification. Most HOH people can use the phone and use hearing aids. </p>
    <p>Characteristics: Individuals who are hard of hearing have partially-impaired hearing in one or both ears, resulting in a mild-to-moderate hearing loss where there may be enough residual hearing that an auditory device, such as a hearing aid or FM system, provides adequate assistance to process speech. A person who hard of hearing has difficulty with sounds, including the audio component of multimedia materials. </p>
    <p>Demographics: According to the World Health Organization, an estimated 466 million people, or 6.1 percent of the world’s population, are deaf or hard of hearing.</p>
    <h4>Central Auditory Processing Disorder </h4>
    <p>Definition: According to the American Speech-Language-Hearing Association:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Auditory processing disorder (APD) is often described as greater than expected difficulty hearing and understanding speech even though no measurable hearing loss exists. Individuals with auditory processing disorders may act as though a hearing loss is present when in fact, hearing sensitivity is often within normal lim<span></span>its. APD is often confused with other disorders such as ADHD, language impair<span></span>ment, learning disabilities, social and emotional delays or cognitive deficits.</li>
      <li>APD is not the inability to hear. It’s the inability to interpret, organize, or analyze what’s heard. All the parts of the hearing pathway are working well. But parts of the brain are not.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Characteristics: People with Central Auditory Processing Disorder can have difficulty with, among other things, locating the source of a sound, understanding what someone is saying if the environment is loud or there are competing sounds, following spoken directions, learning songs or instruments, paying attention, responding in a timely way, or learning a new language. Behaviors can vary depending on the individual and the presence of other disorders. </p>
    <p>Demographics: It is estimated that approximately 5% of the global population have Central Auditory Processing Disorder.</p>
    <h4>Barriers for People with Auditory Disabilities </h4>
    <p>From the W3C’s Web Accessibility Initiative and other sources:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>People speaking softly, or in large spaces without amplification such as through microphones.</li>
      <li>Unavailability of sign language interpretation.</li>
      <li>Environments that are loud or present competing sounds.</li>
      <li>Websites and other technologies that require voice for interaction or listening for understanding.</li>
      <li>Audio in videos and films that are presented without captions or transcripts.</li>
      <li>Media players that do not support caption, or options to control the volume, or the size and colors of captions. </li>

    <h3><span>4.2.3. </span>Deaf-blindness</h3>
    <h4>Overview</h4>
    <p>Deaf-blindness is a rare condition, that requires touch as the primary means of commu<span></span>nication.</p>
    <p>Definition: Deaf-Blindness is that includes both deafness and blindness. Most people who are deafblind are not completely deaf nor completely blind, and retain some hearing and sight capability.</p>
    <p>Characteristics: A person who is both deaf and blind experiences all the characteristics of those two disabilities, with the added complexity that the absence of both vision and hearing severely limits the sensory input possibilities of the individual to just touch, smell, and taste. Of those senses, touch is the only viable method for complex communication. A deafblind person would need to learn braille to access text, and sign language to access conversations (the deafblind person would feel the hands of the other person signing in the conversation).</p>
    <p>Demographics:T he incidence of deaf-blindness is low. According to the World Federation of the Deafblind, between 0.2% and 2% of the world’s population is deaf-blind. </p>
    <h4>Barriers for People with Deaf-Blindness</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>For materials such as books, menus and navigation aids, lack of printed braille.</li>
      <li>websites and other technologies, lack of output to a braille keyboard.</li>
      <li>Lack of transcripts of video or audio materials made available in braille.</li>

    </ul>
    <h3><span>4.2.4. </span>Speech Disabilities</h3>
    <h4>Overview</h4>
    <p>Speech disorders can range from mild slurred speech to the complete inability to move the mouth to speak. The ability to physically speak may be completely unrelated to the person’s language capabilities; they may be able to read, write, and understand lan<span></span>guage, even if their mouth structure or neuromuscular connections do not allow them to articulate. Speech disorders may be caused by or a side-effect of underlying disabilities. A person’s speech may improve, remain stable, or progressively worsen over time. </p>
    <h4>Articulation</h4>
    <p>Definition: According to Texas Children’s Hospital, articulation disorder is a speech disorder involving difficulties in producing specific types of sounds. Articulation disorders often involve substitution of one sound for another, slurring of speech, or indistinct speech. There are three categories of articulation disorders:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>speech sound disorder: When mistakes continue past a certain age.</li>
      <li>phonological process disorder: When there are patterns of not saying words correctly.</li>
      <li>motor speech disorder: When a person has trouble moving muscles required to talk.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Characteristics: According to Stanford Children’s Health, characteristics can include:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Leaving off sounds from words</li>
      <li>Adding sounds to words</li>
      <li>Distorting sounds in words</li>
      <li>Swapping sounds in words</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Demographics: Statistics from the National Institute on Deafness and Other Communication Disorders indicate that the prevalence of speech sound disorders in young children is 8 to 9%. By the first grade, roughly 5 percent of children have noticeable speech disorders, most of which have no known cause.</p>
    <h4>Aphasia</h4>
    <p>Definition: According to the National Aphasia Association definition, “Aphasia is an impairment of language, affecting the production or comprehension of speech and the ability to read or write. Aphasia is always due to injury to the brain-most commonly from a stroke, particularly in older individuals. But brain injuries resulting in aphasia may also arise from head trauma, from brain tumors, or from infections.” </p>
    <p>Characteristics: There are various types of aphasia. A person with aphasia may not be able to recognize words or understand what is being said, be unable to speak or have difficulty saying what they mean, difficulty forming sentences and omitting words. </p>
    <p>Demographics: Statistics from the National Aphasia Association state that:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>There are at least 2,000,000 people in the USA with aphasia</li>
      <li>There are at least 250,000 people in Great Britain with aphasia</li>
    </ul>
    <p>The global incidence rate is currently unknown.</p>
    <h4>No Speech</h4>
    <p>Definition: Having no speech, or mutism, is an inability to speak and can be caused by damage to the brain and / or speech muscles, by emotional or psychological reasons, or by a combination of causes.</p>
    <p>Characteristics: Neurogenic mutism is often a manifestation of extreme forms of other speech disorders, including aphasia, apraxia or dysarthria. There are three types of psychogenic mutism: selective mutism, in which a person chooses not to speak, selective mutism, in which a person wants to speak but due to anxiety cannot in certain situations, and total mutism, in which a person does not speak under any circumstance. </p>
    <p>Demographics: Selective mutism is estimated to affect 0.47 to 0.76 percent of the population. Statistics on the incidence of neurogenic mutism are unavailable. </p>

    <h3><span>4.2.5. </span>Mobility, Flexibility, and Body Structure Disabilities</h3>
    <h4>Overview</h4>
    <p>Mobility impairment includes people with upper or lower limb loss or disability, challeng<span></span>es with manual dexterity, disability in co-ordination with different organs of the body, or with a broken skeletal structure. Physical and mobility impairments cause limitations in independent, purposeful physical movement of the body or of one or more extremities. The alteration in the person’s mobility may be temporary or permanent. Disability in mo<span></span>bility can be congenital, acquired with age, or be the consequence of disease.</p>
    <h4>Manual Dexterity/Fine Motor Control</h4>
    <p>Definition: Fine motor skills are the intricate and detailed movements of the hand and wrist needed to manipulate, control and use objects, produce neat, legible handwriting, and dress independently. Fine motor skills involve the coordinated efforts of the brain and muscles, and are built on the gross motor skills that allow us to make bigger movements. Disability may be temporary, recurring, or permanent.</p>
    <p>Characteristics: Some examples include difficulty tying shoelaces, inability to do up buttons or zippers, scribbly drawing, difficulty using a keyboard, poor handwriting, taking a long time to pick up small objects, manipulating objects in hand, or using both hands at the same time.</p>
    <p>Demographics: Direct statistics are unavailable. However, according to the US National Institutes of Health, difficulties in fine motor skills are prevalent among children with Attention Deficit Disorder, which affects between 3 and 7 percent of children worldwide. </p>
    <h4>Ambulation</h4>
    <p>Definition: The Nursing Outcomes Classification defines ambulation as the ability to walk from place to place independently with or without an assistive device. </p>
    <p>Characteristics: Impairments to a person’s ability to walk may be caused by congenital conditions, disease, or injury, such as cerebral palsy, neuromuscular disorders, amputation, arthritis, and back injuries.</p>
    <p>Demographics: There are no specific statistics on ambulation disabilities. According to the US Centers for Disease Control, 3.5 percent of adults in the US have mobility disabilities.</p>
    <h4>Muscle Fatigue</h4>
    <p>Definition: According to the US National Institutes of Health:</p>
    <p>Muscle fatigue is a common non-specific symptom experienced by many people and is associated with many health conditions. It is often defined as an overwhelming sense of tiredness, lack of energy and feeling of exhaustion, and it relates to a difficulty in per<span></span>forming voluntary tasks.</p>
    <p>Characteristics: According to Healthline.com:</p>
    <p>Muscle fatigue can occur anywhere on the body. An initial sign of this condition is mus<span></span>cle weakness, and other symptoms associated with muscle fatigue include soreness, localized pain, shortness of breath, muscle twitching, trembling, a weak grip, muscle cramps.</p>
    <p>Demographics: There are no specific estimates of percentages of people affected by muscle fatigue, as it can be caused by a variety of factors, such as illness, age, medication and treatment side effects, inactivity, and depression.</p>
    <h4>Body Size or Shape</h4>
    <p>Definition: Body size or shape disabilities are disabilities caused by a variety of disorders that affect a person’s stature, proportions or shape. Examples include acromegaly, dwarfism, rheumatoid arthritis, and obesity.</p>
    <p>Characteristics: Characteristics depend on the cause of disability. Orthopedic conditions, such as arthritis and joint mobility, are frequently associated with the underlying cause. Other examples of co-occurring conditions include muscle weakness and fatigue, hearing loss, vision loss, cardiopulmonary disorders, and diabetes.</p>
    <p>Demographics: Rheumatoid arthritis affects as much as 1% of the worldwide population. It is currently estimated that between 39 - 40 % of adults are obese. </p>

    <h3><span>4.2.6. </span>Cognitive Disabilities</h3>
    <h4>Overview</h4>
    <p>Cognitive disabilities may occur on their own or result from a variety of conditions or in<span></span>juries such as traumatic brain injury. They may also co-occur with other types of disabil<span></span>ities.</p>
    <h4>Intellectual Disabilities</h4>
    <p>Definition: Intellectual disability is characterized by significant limitations both in intellectual functioning (reasoning, learning, problem solving) and in adaptive behavior, which covers a range of everyday social and practical skills. </p>
    <p>Note that definitions vary depending on the country. What are called intellectual disabili<span></span>ties in some countries are called learning disabilities in others.</p>
    <p>According to the American Association of Intellectual and Developmental Disabilities, an individual has intellectual disability if he or she meets three criteria:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Their IQ is below 70-75.</li>
      <li>There are significant limitations in two or more adaptive areas (skills that are needed to live, work, and play in the community, such as communication or self-care).</li>
      <li>The condition manifests itself before the age of 18.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Characteristics: According to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, children with an intellectual disability may:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Sit up, crawl, or walk later than other children.</li>
      <li>Learn to talk later, or have trouble speaking.</li>
      <li>Find it hard to remember things.</li>
      <li>Have trouble understanding social rules.</li>
      <li>Have trouble seeing the results of their actions.</li>
      <li>Have trouble solving problems.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Demographics: It is estimated that between 1 - 3% of the global population, or about 200 million people, have an intellectual disability. The United Nations Development Program estimates that 80 percent of all people with disabilities live in low-income countries.</p>
    <h4>Reading and Dyslexia</h4>
    <p>Definition: Dyslexia is a learning disability that impairs a person’s ability to read. These individuals typically read at levels significantly lower than expected despite having normal intelligence. Although the disorder varies from person to person, common characteristics among people with dyslexia are difficulty with phonological processing (the manipulation of sounds), spelling, and / or rapid visual-verbal responding. In individuals with adult onset of dyslexia, it usually occurs as a result of brain injury or in the context of dementia; this contrasts with individuals with dyslexia who simply were never identified as children or adolescents. Dyslexia can be inherited in some families, and recent studies have identified a number of genes that may predispose an individual to developing dyslexia.</p>
    <p>Characteristics: Reading disabilities may include an inability to perceive text or to process the meaning of words, phrases and ideas. The disability may be the result of a congenital difference, injury, delayed development, neurological or physical disability. Some specific reading disabilities have been identified and are recognized by professionals by diagnosis, such as Dyslexia. Often the diagnosis of a learning disability will include components of a reading impairment.</p>
    <p>Demographics: Dyslexia is thought to be one of the most common language-based learning disabilities. It is the most common cause of reading, writing, and spelling difficulties. Of people with reading difficulties, 70-80% are likely to have some form of dyslexia. It is estimated that between 5-10% of the population has dyslexia, but this number can also be as high as 17% and affects boys and girls in in approximately equal proportions.</p>
    <h4>Math and Computation</h4>
    <p>Definition: Math and computational disabilities impact a person’s ability to learn and communicate math. Dyscalculia involves an inability to understand arithmetic and how to calculate. This disability can be complicated by dysgraphia, an inability to draw or copy figures and graphs, and by anxiety. Dyscalculia may be congenital or result from an injury, disease, or aging.</p>
    <p>Characteristics: According to Understood’s What is Dyscalculia and other sources, common signs of dyscalculia include:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Trouble grasping the meaning of quantities or concepts like biggest vs smallest</li>
      <li>Understanding that the numeral 5 is the same as the word five, and that these both mean five items.</li>
      <li>Remembering math facts in school, like times tables.</li>
      <li>Counting money or making change.</li>
      <li>Estimating time.</li>
      <li>Judging speed or distance.</li>
      <li>Understanding the logic behind math or holding numbers in their head while solv<span></span>ing problems.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Demographics: An estimated 3–6% of people have dyscalculia.</p>
    <h4>Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder</h4>
    <p>Definition: According to the Cleveland Clinic:</p>
    <p>ADHD is a developmental problem characterized by inattention, hyperactivity, and impulsivity. Children with ADHD are easily distracted by sights and sounds in their environment. Symptoms usually appear by age 7. While people do not outgrow this condition, they do learn to adapt.</p>
    <p>Characteristics: According to the Cleveland Clinic, the main symptoms of ADHD are:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Inattention</li>
      <li>Distractibility</li>
      <li>Impulsivity</li>
      <li>Hyperactivity</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Demographics: ADHD affects approximately 11% of the population.</p>
    <h4>Autism Spectrum Disorders</h4>
    <p>Definition: According to the World Health Organization:</p>
    <p>Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) refers to a range of conditions characterised by some degree of impaired social behaviour, communication and language, and a narrow range of interests and activities that are both unique to the individual and carried out repetitively.</p>
    <p>ASDs begin in childhood and tend to persist into adolescence and adulthood. In most cases the conditions are apparent during the first 5 years of life.</p>
    <p>Individuals with ASD often present other co-occurring conditions, including epilepsy, depression, anxiety and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). The level of intellectual functioning in individuals with ASDs is extremely variable, extending from profound impairment to superior levels</p>
    <p>Characteristics: According to the US Center for Disease Control and Prevention, people with ASD may exhibit some of the following traits: </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Not respond to their name by 12 months of age.</li>
      <li>Not point at objects to show interest by 14 months.</li>
      <li>Not play “pretend” games by 18 months.</li>
      <li>Avoid eye contact and want to be alone.</li>
      <li>Have trouble understanding other people’s feelings or talking about their own feelings.</li>
      <li>Have delayed speech and language skills.</li>
      <li>Repeat words or phrases over and over.</li>
      <li>Give unrelated answers to questions.</li>
      <li>Get upset by minor changes.</li>
      <li>Have obsessive interests.</li>
      <li>Flap their hands, rock their body, or spin in circles.</li>
      <li>Have unusual reactions to the way things sound, smell, taste, look, or feel.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Demographics: Worldwide, approximately one in 160 children has ASD, though it is reportedly higher is some countries, and its prevalence is increasing.</p>
    <h4>Non-verbal Learning Disability</h4>
    <p>Definition: According to the University of Michigan, Michigan Medicine resource, YourChild Development and Behavior Resources, Non-verbal Learning Disability:</p>
    <p>Nonverbal Learning Disability is very much like Asperger Syndrome, in which people with the syndrome have normal intelligence and language development, but have trouble with social skills, sensory input, and making transitions. AS and NLD are generally thought to describe the same kind of disorder but to differ in severity, with AS describing more severe symptoms.</p>
    <p>Characteristics: According to the University of Michigan, Michigan Medicine, some of the signs of NLD include:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Great vocabulary and verbal expression</li>
      <li>Excellent memory skills</li>
      <li>Attention to detail, but missing the big picture</li>
      <li>Poor abstract reasoning</li>
      <li>Concrete thinking</li>
      <li>Physical awkwardness, poor coordination</li>
      <li>Poor social skills</li>
      <li>Trouble adjusting to changes</li>
      <li>Anxiety, depression, low self-esteem</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Demographics: Studies estimate that around 1 in 100, or 1 percent, of children in the United States may have NVLD. It tends to affect boys and girls about equally.</p>

    <h3><span>4.2.7. </span>Seizure Disabilities</h3>
    <h4>Overview</h4>
    <p>Seizure disabilities occur when a seizure disorder interferes with a person’s regular ac<span></span>tivities. Seizures can range from mild to severe, including loss of consciousness.</p>
    <h4>General Seizure Disorders</h4>
    <p>Definition: According to the Mayo Clinic:</p>
    <p>A seizure is a sudden, uncontrolled electrical disturbance in the brain. It can cause changes in behavior, movements or feelings, and in levels of consciousness. If a person has two or more seizures or a tendency to have recurrent seizures, they have epilepsy.</p>
    <p>Characteristics: According to the Merck Manual, depending on the type of seizure, symptoms during a seizure can include:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Visual hallucinations</li>
      <li>inability to speak</li>
      <li>Convulsions</li>
      <li>Loss of muscle tone</li>
      <li>Staring</li>
      <li>Falling down</li>
      <li>Biting the tongue</li>
      <li>Loss of control of the bladder or bowels</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Demographics: About 2% of adults have a seizure at some point in their life. Two thirds of these people never have another one. Seizure disorders commonly begin in early childhood or in late adulthood</p>
    <h4>Photosensitive Epilepsy</h4>
    <p>Definition: According to Epilepsy Action:</p>
    <p>Photosensitive epilepsy is a condition in which people affected have seizures triggered by flashing or flickering lights, or patterns. There are 2 groups of people who have photosensitive epilepsy: people who only have seizures triggered by flashing or flickering lights, or patterns (sometimes called pure photosensitivity), and people who have seizures triggered by flashing or flickering lights or patterns but also have seizures at other times.</p>
    <p>Characteristics: According to Epilepsy Action:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Different people will be affected by lights at different flash or flicker rates. Lights that flash or flicker between 16 and 25 times a second are the most likely to trig<span></span>ger seizures. But some people are sensitive to rates as low as 3 or as high as 60 a second.</li>
      <li>Different people may be affected by different types of pattern. Those patterns with a high contrast or some that move are more likely to trigger seizures. Some video games often contain potentially provocative light stimulation.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Demographics: Approximately 3% of people with epilepsy have photosensitive epilepsy.</p>
    <h4>Barriers for People with Seizure Disabilities</h4>
    <p>From the W3C’s Web Accessibility Initiative and other sources:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Activities in which a sudden loss of consciousness could cause serious harm, such as swimming, taking a bath, or using power tools.</li>
      <li>Driving.</li>
      <li>Moving, blinking, or flickering content in videos, films, websites, and other tech<span></span>nologies.</li>
      <li>Web browsers and media players that do not provide controls to stop or turn off video or animations discrimination.</li>

      <li>Feel nauseous.</li>
      <li>Show a rigid body posture, make little eye contact, or speak with an overly soft voice.</li>
      <li>Find it scary and difficult to be with other people, especially those they don’t already know, and have a hard time talking to them even though they wish they could.</li>
      <li>very self-conscious in front of other people and feel embarrassed and awk<span></span>ward.</li>
      <li>very afraid that other people will judge them.</li>
      <li>Stay away from places where there are other people.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Demographics: The prevalence of anxiety disorders across the world varies from 2.5 - 7% by country. In 2017, an estimated 284 million people experienced an anxiety disorder, making it the most prevalent mental health disorder.</p>
    <h4>Emotional Disabilities</h4>
    <p>Definition: According to the Center for Parent Information and Resources:</p>
    <p>Emotional disturbance is defined as a condition exhibiting one or more of the following characteristics over a long period of time and to a marked degree that adversely affects a child’s educational performance:</p>

    <p>Assistive technologies are products used by people with disabilities to help accomplish tasks which they could not accomplish otherwise. When used with computers, assistive technologies are also referred to as adaptive technologies or adaptive software. Some assistive technologies rely on the output of other user agents, such as graphical desk<span></span>top browsers, text browsers, voice browsers, multimedia players, and plug-ins. </p>
    <p>Adaptive strategies are solutions meant to help people with disabilities perform activities of daily living and increase their independence and ability to participate in society. Adap<span></span>tive strategies provide enhancements to, or change the methods of, interacting with the environment or technology needed to accomplish a task.</p>

    <h3>Recommended Study Tasks</h3>
    <p>Familiarize yourself with the demographics and statistics of populations living with dis<span></span>abilities in various regions around the world.</p>
    <h3>Overview</h3>
    <p>Statistical data on disability is collected and categorized in different ways, so it is import<span></span>ant to understand each study within its context.</p>
    <p>According to the Rehabilitation Research and Training Center on Disability Statistics and Demographics, Institute on Disability/UCED, University of New Hampshire, 2017 Disability Statistics Annual Report:</p>
    <p>Disability statistics generally highlight country and trend data in an attempt at address<span></span>ing questions such as:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>How many people with disabilities live in a given country, region or in the world?</li>
      <li>What are the percentages of people with different types of disabilities in different age groups?</li>
      <li>How many people with disabilities are employed?</li>
      <li>How much disposable income do people with disabilities have?</li>
      <li>How many people with disabilities are below in poverty?</li>
      <li>How many people with disability smoke, are obesity, have diabetes or have a heart disease?</li>
    </ul>
    <p>From Eurostat’s report, Disability Statistics Introduced:</p>
    <p>Data regarding the functional status of people needs should be taken as a key input for public policy areas such as health, social protection, housing, transport, culture, education and employment. Policy development in these areas can benefit from reliable data on the functional status of the population.</p>

    <h3>Recommended Study Tasks</h3>
    <p>Describe and follow disability etiquette guidelines for interacting with people with disabil<span></span>ities.</p>
    <p>Judge the appropriateness of various ways of referring to or about people with disabili<span></span>ties.</p>
    <h3>Overview</h3>
    <p>Disability etiquette is a set of guidelines on how to approach a person with disabilities and treat them with respect. For example:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>You should speak to the person directly, not to the person accompanying them.</li>
      <li>not make assumptions about what the person can or cannot do.</li>
      <li>Since the impact of a specific disability can vary widely from person to person, you should offer assistance only if the person requests it or after you have asked their permission.</li>
      <li>Acknowledge the individual’s ability to make decisions and judgments on their own behalf.</li>
      <li>Use language and terminology that places people first.</li>
      <li>Avoid referring to people by their disability. </li>

    </ul>
    <h3>Overview</h3>
    <p>According to Ireland’s National Disability Authority’s Centre for Excellence in Universal Design:</p>
    <p>Universal design is the design and composition of an environment so that it can be ac<span></span>cessed, understood and used to the greatest extent possible by all people regardless of their age, size, ability or disability. An environment (or any building, product, or service in that environment) should be designed to meet the needs of all people who wish to use it. This is not a special requirement, for the benefit of only a minority of the population. It is a fundamental condition of good design. If an environment is accessible, usable, convenient and a pleasure to use, everyone benefits. By considering the diverse needs and abilities of all throughout the design process, universal design creates products, services and environments that meet peoples’ needs. Simply put, universal design is good design.</p>

    <h3>Overview</h3>
    <p>Web accessibility is the ability of a website or application to be easily navigated and understood by a wide range of people, including those who have disabilities.</p>
    <p>It combines web development and file creation standards with universal design practic<span></span>es to create websites and applications that are accessible to a broad spectrum of peo<span></span>ple.</p>
    <p>According to the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) Web Accessibility Initiative Intro<span></span>duction to Web Accessibility page:</p>
    <p>Web accessibility means that websites, tools, and technologies are designed and de<span></span>veloped so that people with disabilities can use them. More specifically, people must be able to perceive, understand, navigate, interact with and contribute to the Web.</p>
    <p>Web accessibility addresses all disabilities that affect access to the Web, including audi<span></span>tory, cognitive, neurological, physical, speech and visual. Web accessibility also benefits people without disabilities, including:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>People using mobile phones, smart watches, smart TVs, and other devices with small screens, different input modes, etc.</li>
      <li>Older people with changing abilities due to aging.</li>

    <h3><span>5.6.1. </span>Principles of Universal Design for Learning</h3>
    <h3>Recommended Study Tasks</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Identify and describe the three UDL guidelines.</li>
      <li>Become familiar with the options instructors should provide for each.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Overview</h3>
    <p>The Universal Design for Learning guidelines provides a framework to improve teaching and learning. It is based on research findings on learner diversity.</p>
    <p>(Adapted from CAST: The UDL Guidelines)</p>
    <h4>Provide Multiple Means of Engagement</h4>
    <p>Affect represents a crucial element to learning, and learners differ markedly in the ways in which they can be engaged or motivated to learn. There are a variety of sources that can influence individual variation in affect including neurology, culture, personal relevance, subjectivity, and background knowledge, along with a variety of other fac<span></span>tors. Some learners are highly engaged by spontaneity and novelty while others are disengaged, even frightened, by those aspects, preferring strict routine. Some learners might like to work alone, while others prefer to work with their peers. In reality, there is not one means of engagement that will be optimal for all learners in all contexts; provid<span></span>ing multiple options for engagement is essential.</p>
    <p>Instructors should provide options for:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Recruiting learners’ interest</li>
      <li>Learners to sustain their efforts</li>
      <li>Learners to self-regulate</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Provide Multiple Means of Representation</h4>
    <p>Learners differ in the ways that they perceive and comprehend information that is pre<span></span>sented to them. For example, those with sensory disabilities (e.g., blindness or deaf<span></span>ness); learning disabilities (e.g., dyslexia); language or cultural differences, and so forth may all require different ways of approaching content. Others may simply grasp infor<span></span>mation quicker or more efficiently through visual or auditory means rather than printed text. Also learning, and transfer of learning, occurs when multiple representations are used, because they allow students to make connections within, as well as between, concepts. In short, there is not one means of representation that will be optimal for all learners; providing options for representation is essential.</p>
    <p>Instructors should provide options for:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Perception through different modalities</li>
      <li>Language and symbols</li>
      <li>Comprehension through the design and presentation of information that builds scaffolds for knowledge</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Provide Multiple Means of Action and Expression</h4>
    <p>Learners differ in the ways that they can navigate a learning environment and express what they know. For example, individuals with significant movement im<span></span>pairments (e.g., cerebral palsy), those who struggle with strategic and organizational abilities (executive function disorders), those who have language barriers, and so forth approach learning tasks very differently. Some may be able to express themselves well in written text but not speech, and vice versa. It should also be recognized that action and expression require a great deal of strategy, practice, and organization, and this is another area in which learners can differ. In reality, there is not one means of action and expression that will be optimal for all learners; providing options for action and expression is essential. </p>
    <p>Instructors should provide options for:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Interacting with tools and environments that make learning physically accessi<span></span>ble</li>
      <li>Learners to express themselves and communicate</li>
      <li>Building learners’ executive functions through scaffolding</li>
    </ul>
    <h3><span>5.6.2. </span>Usability and User Experience (UX)</h3>
    <h3>Recommended Study Tasks</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Describe the differences between usability and user experience.</li>
      <li>Understand how Usability and User Experience complement each other.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Overview</h3>
    <p>As user experience has grown as a discipline and practice, it has come to be under<span></span>stood as more comprehensive than usability. While usability, and accessibility, are necessary to the successful design of any product, the experience of it includes every interaction point a person has with it, including becoming aware of it, acquiring or ac<span></span>cessing it, using it for the first and subsequent times, and the level of trust and feeling of satisfaction with it.</p>
    <p>The Interaction Design Foundation, in its article Usability: A Part of the User Experience, describes the differences between usability and UX:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Usability refers to the ease of access and / or use of a product or website. It’s a sub-discipline of User Experience design. Although user experience design (UX Design) and usability were once used interchangeably, we must now understand that usability provides an important contribution to UX; however, it’s not the whole of the experience.</li>
      <li>usability, designers have to focus on three aspects in particular:</li>
      <li>Users should find it easy and become proficient when using a design interface.</li>
      <li>They should be able to achieve their goal easily through using that design.</li>
      <li>They should be able to learn the interface easily, so that return visits are just as, if not more, easy.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Meanwhile, core areas of the user experience include:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Usability: a measure of a user’s ability to arrive on a site, use it easily, and com<span></span>plete the desired task. </li>
      <li>Useful content: The website should include enough information in an easily di<span></span>gestible format so that users can make informed decisions. </li>
      <li>Desirable/Pleasurable Content: The best user experiences come when the user can form an emotional bond with the product or website.</li>
      <li>Accessibility: There are a set of <a href="https://www.interaction-design.org/literature/topics/accessibility" lang="en-US">There are a set of accessibility standards sites should conform to in order to be used by people with disabilities</a> standards sites should conform to in order to be used by people with disabilities. </li>
      <li>Credibility: The trust (levels of security and privacy) that a website engenders in users also plays a part in the user experience.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Usability must be considered alongside these other concerns to create a great user experience. The UX comes as much from graphical design, interactive design, content, etc. as it does from usability alone. </p>

    <h1><span>6. </span>Standards, Laws, and Management Strategies </h1>
    <h2><span>6.1. </span>International Declarations and Conventions on Disability Rights</h2>
    <h3>Recommended Study Tasks</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Name the most prominent international declarations and conventions that protect human rights and the rights of people with disabilities.</li>
      <li>Explain the main purpose and protections of the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Overview</h3>
    <p>Because approximately 15% of the world’s population is comprised of people with dis<span></span>abilities, as a group they represent the world’s largest minority. However, it only recent<span></span>ly that people with disabilities have been protected in international human rights law. People with disabilities are not listed among the groups protected against discrimination in the 1948 Universal Declaration of Human Rights. In 1975, the United Nations passed the Declaration on the Rights of Disabled Persons, but since it was a declaration, and not a convention, it could only provide a framework and recommendations. The United Nations’ 2006 Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities was developed in response to concerns that there was no legally binding convention on protecting and recognizing the rights of people with disabilities in the existing human rights declarations and conventions.</p>

    <h3><span>6.1.1. </span>The Universal Declaration of Human Rights</h3>
    <p>In its introduction to the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, The United Nation’s Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights states that:</p>
    <p>The Universal Declaration of Human Rights (UDHR) is a milestone document in the history of human rights. Drafted by representatives with different legal and cultural backgrounds from all regions of the world, it set out, for the first time, fundamental human rights to be universally protected.</p>
    <h3><span>6.1.2. </span>Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (CRPD)</h3>
    <p>In its introduction to The Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, The United Nation’s Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights states that:</p>
    <p>The Convention follows decades of work by the United Nations to change attitudes and approaches to persons with disabilities. It takes to a new height the movement from viewing persons with disabilities as “objects” of charity, medical treatment and social protection towards viewing persons with disabilities as “subjects” with rights, who are capable of claiming those rights and making decisions for their lives based on their free and informed consent as well as being active members of society.</p>
    <p>The Convention is intended as a human rights instrument with an explicit, social de<span></span>velopment dimension. It adopts a broad categorization of persons with disabilities and reaffirms that all persons with all types of disabilities must enjoy all human rights and fundamental freedoms. It clarifies and qualifies how all categories of rights apply to persons with disabilities and identifies areas where adaptations have to be made for persons with disabilities to effectively exercise their rights and areas where their rights have been violated, and where protection of rights must be reinforced.</p>
    <p>The Convention was negotiated during eight sessions of an Ad Hoc Committee of the General Assembly from 2002 to 2006, making it the fastest negotiated human rights treaty.</p>
    <h3><span>6.1.3. </span>The Marrakesh Treaty</h3>
    <p>The purpose of the Marrakesh Treaty to Facilitate Access to Published Works for Per<span></span>sons who are Blind, Visually Impaired, or Otherwise Print Disabled is to ensure that people who have vision or other print disabilities have access to books and other printed materials. In its introduction to the treaty, the World Intellectual Property Organization states that:</p>
    <p>The Marrakesh Treaty was adopted on June 27, 2013 in Marrakesh and it forms part of the body of international copyright treaties administered by WIPO. It has a clear humanitarian and social development dimension and its main goal is to create a set of mandatory limitations and exceptions for the benefit of the blind, visually impaired, and otherwise print disabled (VIPs).</p>

    <h3><span>6.2.1. </span>Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union</h3>
    <p>Europe’s Equality and Human Rights Commission describes the Charter:</p>
    <p>The Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union (the Charter) brings together the fundamental rights of everyone living in the EU. It was introduced to bring consisten<span></span>cy and clarity to the rights established at different times and in different ways in individu<span></span>al EU Member States.</p>
    <p>The Charter sets out the full range of civil, political, economic and social rights based on:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>The fundamental rights and freedoms recognised by the European Convention on Human Rights</li>
      <li>The constitutional traditions of the EU Member States, for example, longstanding protections of rights which exist in the common law and constitutional law of the UK and other EU Member States</li>
      <li>The Council of Europe’s Social Charter</li>
      <li>The Community Charter of Fundamental Social Rights of Workers, and</li>
      <li>Other international conventions to which the EU or its Member States are par<span></span>ties.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>The Charter became legally binding on EU Member States when the Treaty of Lisbon entered into force in December 2009. Relevant articles include:</p>
    <p>Article 26: Integration of persons with disabilities</p>
    <p>The Union recognises and respects the right of persons with disabilities to benefit from measures designed to ensure their independence, social and occupational integration and participation in the life of the community.</p>
    <p>Article 21: Non-discrimination</p>
    <p>Any discrimination based on any ground such as sex, race, colour, ethnic or social origin, genetic features, language, religion or belief, political or any other opinion, mem<span></span>bership of a national minority, property, birth, disability, age or sexual orientation shall be prohibited.</p>
    <h3><span>6.2.2. </span>The African Charter on Human and People’s Rights</h3>
    <p>Although the Charter does not specify disability, Article 2 recognizes the rights of all persons:</p>
    <p>ARTICLE 2:</p>
    <p>Every individual shall be entitled to the enjoyment of the rights and freedoms rec<span></span>ognised and guaranteed in the present Charter without distinction of any kind such as race, ethnic group, colour, sex, language, religion, political or any other opinion, national and social origin, fortune, birth or any status.</p>
    <h3><span>6.2.3. </span>The Inter-American Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Persons with Disabilities</h3>
    <p>Articles II and III of the Convention lay out the Convention’s objectives and how they will be achieved.</p>
    <p>Article II:</p>
    <p>The objectives of this Convention are to prevent and eliminate all forms of discrimina<span></span>tion against persons with disabilities and to promote their full integration into society.</p>
    <p>Article III:</p>
    <p>To achieve the objectives of this Convention, the states parties undertake:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>adopt the legislative, social, educational, labor-related, or any other measures needed to eliminate discrimination against persons with disabilities and to pro<span></span>mote their full integration into society, including, but not limited to:</li>
      <li>Measures to eliminate discrimination gradually and to promote integration by government authorities and / or private entities in providing or making available goods, services, facilities, programs, and activities such as employment, trans<span></span>portation, communications, housing, recreation, education, sports, law enforce<span></span>ment and administration of justice, and political and administrative activities;</li>
      <li>Measures to ensure that new buildings, vehicles, and facilities constructed or manufactured within their respective territories facilitate transportation, communi<span></span>cations, and access by persons with disabilities;</li>
      <li>Measures to eliminate, to the extent possible, architectural, transportation, and communication obstacles to facilitate access and use by persons with disabilities; and</li>
      <li>Measures to ensure that persons responsible for applying this Convention and domestic law in this area are trained to do so.</li>
      <li>work on a priority basis in the following areas:</li>
      <li>Prevention of all forms of preventable disabilities;</li>
      <li>Early detection and intervention, treatment, rehabilitation, education, job training, and the provision of comprehensive services to ensure the optimal level of inde<span></span>pendence and quality of life for persons with disabilities; and</li>
      <li>Increasing of public awareness through educational campaigns aimed at elim<span></span>inating prejudices, stereotypes, and other attitudes that jeopardize the right of persons to live as equals, thus promoting respect for and coexistence with per<span></span>sons with disabilities;</li>
    </ul>
    <h2><span>6.3. </span>National and Provincial Instruments on Disability Rights</h2>
    <h3>Recommended Study Tasks</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Identify prominent national and provincial instruments, such as laws and acts, that protect people with disabilities.</li>
      <li>Explain the main purposes of each.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Overview</h3>
    <p>Civil rights protections for people with disabilities have spread rapidly across many countries in the last thirty years. In the US, the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) was adopted in 1990 as one of several US disability-related laws. In Europe, thirty-three countries adopted at least some form of disability equality protections over a twenty-five-year period.</p>
    <p>The shift from the medical to the social model of disability is a main driver of the legal shift from a welfare or social security law model towards anti-discrimination or equality law. Such laws are intended to challenge segregation and exclusion as forms of dis<span></span>crimination against people with disabilities, usually by requiring social institutions (gov<span></span>ernments, corporations, educational institutions, individuals, etc.) to reduce or eliminate discrimination. The other driver considered pivotal to the integration of disability rights in law in many countries is the United Nations Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities. </p>
    <p>Most laws share an equality focus rather than a focus on foster social welfare provi<span></span>sions, and disability discrimination laws are considered a truly new development in disability policy around the world. Laws that treat disability as a discrimination category recognize that persons with disabilities are persons with rights instead of problems.</p>
    <p>Some disability civil rights laws include prescriptive guidelines or checklists for measur<span></span>ing accessibility in such areas as architecture and the built environment, employment and the workplace, educational settings, retail venues, hospitality and entertainment.</p>

    <h3><span>6.3.1. </span>The Equality Act 2010</h3>
    <p>The United Kingdom passed the Equality Act 2010 in order to bring together formerly disparate anti-discrimination laws and strengthen them, in order to provide people with improved protections from discrimination in the workplace and society. The Introductory Text reads:</p>
    <p>An Act to make provision to require Ministers of the Crown and others when making strategic decisions about the exercise of their functions to have regard to the desirability of reducing socio-economic inequalities; to reform and harmonise equality law and restate the greater part of the enactments relating to discrimination and harassment related to certain personal characteristics; to enable certain employers to be required to publish information about the differences in pay between male and female employees; to prohibit victimisation in certain circumstances; to require the exercise of certain functions to be with regard to the need to eliminate discrimination and other prohibited conduct; to enable duties to be imposed in relation to the exercise of public procurement functions; to increase equality of opportunity; to amend the law relating to rights and responsibilities in family relationships; and for connected purposes.</p>
    <p>Section 4 of the Act articulates which characteristics of persons are protected:</p>
    <p>(4) The protected characteristics</p>
    <p>The following characteristics are protected characteristics—</p>
    <ul>
      <li>age</li>
      <li>disability</li>
      <li>gender reassignment</li>
      <li>marriage and civil partnership</li>

      <li>sex</li>
      <li>sexual orientation</li>
    </ul>
    <h3><span>6.3.2. </span>The Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990</h3>
    <p>The Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) is a civil rights law that puts in place protec<span></span>tions for people with disabilities, similar to those provided to on the basis of race, color, sex, national origin, age, and religion. It guarantees equal opportunities for people with disabilities in public accommodations, employment, transportation, state and local gov<span></span>ernment services, and telecommunications.</p>
    <p>The Findings of Chapter 126, Equal Opportunity for Individuals with Disabilities, state:</p>
    <p>The Congress finds that:</p>
    <ol start="1" type="1">
      <li>physical or mental disabilities in no way diminish a person’s right to fully participate in all aspects of society, yet many people with physical or mental disabilities have been precluded from doing so because of discrimination; others who have a record of a disability or are regarded as having a disability also have been subjected to discrimination;</li>
      <li>historically, society has tended to isolate and segregate individuals with disabilities, and, despite some improvements, such forms of discrimination against individuals with disabilities continue to be a serious and pervasive social problem;</li>
      <li>discrimination against individuals with disabilities persists in such critical areas as employment, housing, public accommodations, education, transportation, communication, recreation, institutionalization, health services, voting, and access to public services;</li>
      <li>unlike individuals who have experienced discrimination on the basis of race, color, sex, national origin, religion, or age, individuals who have experienced discrimination on the basis of disability have often had no legal recourse to redress such discrimination;</li>
      <li>individuals with disabilities continually encounter various forms of discrimination, including outright intentional exclusion, the discriminatory effects of architectural, transportation, and communication barriers, overprotective rules and policies, failure to make modifications to existing facilities and practices, exclusionary qualification standards and criteria, segregation, and relegation to lesser services, programs, activities, benefits, jobs, or other opportunities;</li>
      <li>census data, national polls, and other studies have documented that people with disabilities, as a group, occupy an inferior status in our society, and are severely disadvantaged socially, vocationally, economically, and educationally;</li>
      <li>the Nation’s proper goals regarding individuals with disabilities are to assure equality of opportunity, full participation, independent living, and economic self-sufficiency for such individuals; and</li>
      <li>the continuing existence of unfair and unnecessary discrimination and prejudice denies people with disabilities the opportunity to compete on an equal basis and to pursue those opportunities for which our free society is justifiably famous, and costs the United States billions of dollars in unnecessary expenses resulting from dependency and non-productivity.</li>
    </ol>
    <h3><span>6.3.3. </span>Ontarians with Disabilities Act of 2001</h3>
    <p>The Ontarians with Disabilities Act, with ongoing refinements, ensures the rights of peo<span></span>ple with disabilities to equal opportunities and to be free from discrimination. Its pream<span></span>ble reads:</p>
    <p>The people of Ontario support the right of persons of all ages with disabilities to enjoy equal opportunity and to participate fully in the life of the province.</p>
    <p>Ontarians with disabilities experience barriers to participating in the mainstream of Ontario society. The number of persons with disabilities is expected to increase as the population ages, since the incidence of disability increases with age.</p>
    <p>The Government of Ontario is committed to working with every sector of society to build on what it has already achieved together with those sectors and to move towards a province in which no new barriers are created and existing ones are removed. This responsibility rests with every social and economic sector, every region, every government, every organization, institution and association, and every person in Ontario.</p>

    <h3>Recommended study tasks</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Name prominent examples of accessibility laws and regulations applied to ICT.</li>
      <li>Identify the main enforcement mechanisms of each.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Overview</h3>
    <p>Most countries provide laws protecting the civil rights of disabled persons for homes, parks, businesses, and educational facilities. However, this has not been the case with ICT accessibility in all countries.</p>
    <p>In the US, federal, state, and local government websites must meet Section 508 regula<span></span>tions, which are based on the W3C Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.1.</p>
    <p>The Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) does not include any legal standards for website accessibility owned by private businesses or non-profit organizations. Never<span></span>theless, business and other organizations can be sued for lack of accessibility. Title III of the ADA prohibits discrimination based on disability in the activities of places of public accommodation, which includes businesses, schools, places of recreation, offices, and medical buildings. E-commerce and organizational websites and public mobile applica<span></span>tions fall under Title III. </p>
    <p>The ADA is enforced by the US Department of Justice Civil Rights Division, and in the case of educational institutions by the US Department of Education Office for Civil Rights, through consent decrees and settlements.</p>
    <p>In Europe, the Web Accessibility Directive and The European Accessibility Act set stan<span></span>dards and requirements in the European Union:</p>
    <p>The European Union Web Accessibility Directive 2016 / 2102, which took effect in September 2018, establishes the accessibility standards rules that all public sector websites and applications in EU member states must implement, maintain, and enforce or risk fines and legal penalties. The Directive refers to the EN 301 549 standards to make websites and mobile apps more accessible. Requirements for websites and applications include:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Ensuring websites and applications are accessible</li>
      <li>accessibility statement</li>
      <li>method for users to report inaccessibility</li>
      <li>link to enforcement procedures</li>
    </ul>
    <p>The European Accessibility Act, passed by the European Commission in June 2019, covers products and services identified as most important for people with disabilities provides common rules, including a comprehensive set of minimum requirements for all private businesses including manufacturers, representatives, importers and distributors (except microenterprises) to make a range of products and services accessible for per<span></span>sons with disabilities including:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Computers and operating systems</li>
      <li>ATMs</li>
      <li>Ticketing and check-in machines</li>
      <li>Smartphones</li>
      <li>equipment related to digital television services</li>
      <li>Telephony services and related equipment</li>
      <li>Access to audio-visual media services such as television broadcast and related consumer equipment</li>
      <li>Services related to air, bus, rail and waterborne passenger transport</li>
      <li>Banking services</li>
      <li>books</li>
      <li>commerce</li>
    </ul>
    <p>The Act allows for NGOs, the responsible national authority or other bodies to go to court on behalf of an individual under national law. It also allows for the imposition of penalties for non-compliance with accessibility standards. Each member state is respon<span></span>sible for enforcement. </p>

    <h3>Recommended Study Tasks</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Describe recommended steps to follow to adopt an ICT accessibility plan across your organization.</li>
      <li>Understand the utility of accessibility maturity models.</li>
      <li>Describe the importance of management champions.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Overview</h3>
    <p>To be successful within an organization, ICT accessibility must be approached strategi<span></span>cally and programmatically, and implemented as an integral and ongoing activity. It must be a program, not a project.</p>
    <p>This section presents recommendations for designing and implementing organizational strategy for ICT accessibility. It also presents example maturity models, which provide methods for defining, managing, and measuring an organization’s performance in meet<span></span>ing ICT accessibility best practices. Several models are available, and it is recommend<span></span>ed you work with one that best meets the culture and needs of your organization.</p>

    <h3><span>6.6.2. </span>W3C Web Accessibility Initiative Recommendations</h3>
    <p>The World Wide Web Consortium’s Web Accessibility Initiative provides detailed recom<span></span>mendations for planning, implementing, and sustaining an organizational ICT accessibil<span></span>ity program:</p>
    <h4>Initiate</h4>
    <p>To succeed, a web accessibility effort must be well grounded in organizational culture, process, and practice. To do this, align accessibility with existing organizational ap<span></span>proaches; develop and communicate clear, measurable objectives; and engage stake<span></span>holders to secure understanding and broad support throughout the organization.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Learn the basics</li>
      <li>Explore the current environment</li>
      <li>Set objectives</li>
      <li>Develop the business case</li>
      <li>Raise awareness</li>
      <li>Gather support</li>
      <li>Plan</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Careful planning is critical to effective implementation of any accessibility effort. It en<span></span>sures a clear assessment of the required work, distribution of tasks, and continual follow-up on progress.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Create an accessibility policy</li>
      <li>Assign responsibilities</li>
      <li>Determine budget and resources</li>
      <li>Review environment</li>
      <li>Review websites</li>
      <li>Establish a monitoring framework</li>
      <li>Engage with stakeholders</li>
      <li>Implement</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Weave accessibility implementation throughout the process to minimize overhead and improve the overall quality of the final outcome. Prioritize quick wins and communicate progress to increase commitment and develop a sense of accomplishment.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Build skills and expertise</li>
      <li>Integrate goals into policies</li>
      <li>Assign tasks and support delivery</li>
      <li>Evaluate early and regularly</li>
      <li>Prioritize issues</li>
      <li>Track and communicate progress</li>
      <li>Sustain</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Keeping momentum helps with the accessibility maintenance for completed projects and builds on completed work for new projects. Regular reviews of content, organiza<span></span>tional processes, and resources will help ensure that accessibility remains a priority and issues are identified. Developing a management reporting process will help ensure that it is clear where activity is required for follow-up work.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Monitor websites</li>
      <li>Engage with stakeholders</li>
      <li>Track standards and legislation</li>
      <li>Adapt to new technologies</li>
      <li>Incorporate user feedback</li>
    </ul>
    <h3><span>6.6.3. </span>European Agency for Special Needs &amp; Inclusive Education Guidelines</h3>
    <p>The Guidelines are published as a freely available resource, and are designed for orga<span></span>nizations that want to ensure the information they produce is accessible. The Guidelines include the following recommendations:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Include an accessibility statement in the organization’s long-term strategy.</li>
      <li>Develop a strategy or plan for implementing accessible information.</li>
      <li>Make someone responsible for implementing the information accessibility plan and provide them with the required resources.</li>
      <li>Plan an incremental implementation – be ambitious and modest at the same time.</li>
      <li>Embed accessibility into your information production and dissemination process<span></span>es.</li>
      <li>Provide information, education and training on accessibility for all staff.</li>
      <li>When outsourcing information production, make sure accessibility requirements are addressed and undergo a quality check. </li>
    </ul>

          <li>Conduct accessibility testing before releasing any services or publishing any information.</li>
        </ul></li>
    </ol>
    <h3><span>6.6.4. </span>The Capability Maturity Model for Software, Adapted</h3>
    <p>The Capability Maturity Model, developed by Carnegie Mellon University, is an IT pro<span></span>cess improvement model that was initially designed for software development, but it can be applied to measure an organization’s ICT accessibility maturity. Version 1.1, which is freely available, is adapted here to ICT accessibility:</p>
    <h4>Maturity Levels</h4>
    <ol start="1" type="1">
      <li>Initial
        <ul>
          <li>Capability is ad hoc and unpredictable. The organization typically does not pro<span></span>vide a stable environment for developing and maintaining accessible products, service, and information.</li>
          <li>Repeatable</li>
        </ul></li>
      <li>Policies are in place for managing projects and procedures for ICT accessibili<span></span>ty. Processes can be characterized as:
        <ul>
          <li>Practiced</li>
          <li>Documented</li>
          <li>Enforced</li>
          <li>Trained</li>
          <li>Measured</li>
          <li>Able to improve</li>
        </ul></li>
      <li>Defined
        <ul>
          <li>Standard processes for developing and maintaining ICT accessibility across the organization are documented, and these processes are integrated into a coherent whole. Processes are used, and changed as appropriate, to help the and staff perform more effectively.</li>
        </ul></li>
      <li>Managed</li>
    </ol>
    <p>The organization sets quantitative quality goals for products and processes. Processes include well-defined and consistent measurements.</p>
    <ol start="5" type="1">
      <li>Optimizing</li>
    </ol>
    <p>The entire organization is focused on continuous process improvement. The organization identifies weaknesses and strengthens the process proactively, with the goal of preventing the occurrence of defects. Innovations that exploit best practices are identified and transferred throughout the organization.</p>
    <h4>Key Practices</h4>
    <p>Each maturity level is attained through commitment to key practices, which include the following common features and what they typically involve: </p>
    <ol start="1" type="1">
      <li>Commitment to perform</li>
    </ol>
    <p>Establishment of organizational policies and senior management sponsorship.</p>
    <ol start="2" type="1">
      <li>Ability to perform</li>
    </ol>
    <p>Resources, organizational structures, and training.</p>
    <ol start="3" type="1">
      <li>Activities performed</li>
    </ol>
    <p>Establishment of plans and procedures, performing and tracking work, taking corrective action as needed.</p>
    <ol start="4" type="1">
      <li>Measurement and analysis</li>
    </ol>
    <p>Examples of measurements for determining the status and effectiveness of the activities performed.</p>
    <ol start="5" type="1">
      <li>Verifying implementation</li>
    </ol>
    <p>Reviews and audits by management and quality assurance.</p>
    <h3><span>6.6.5. </span>Business Disability Forum’s Accessibility Maturity Model </h3>
    <p>Business Disability Forum’s Technology Taskforce developed the Accessibility Maturity Model as a self-assessment tool to help organizations benchmark their progress in all aspects of accessibility.</p>
    <p>It is based on the Accessible Technology Charter, which lays out ten commitments to good practices in ICT accessibility. Organizations make a public commitment to accessi<span></span>bility when they sign the Charter. It reads as follows:</p>
    <h4>Accessible Technology Charter</h4>
    <p>We will ensure people living with a disability or who acquire a disability can apply for jobs with us, be employed by us, and do business with us, by implementing an inclusive technology strategy which includes the following commitments to accessibility:</p>
    <ol start="1" type="1">
      <li>will appoint an Executive Level Technology Champion who will report to the board, raise awareness of the benefits of this agenda and ensure that we achieve continuous improvement in this area.</li>
      <li>will ensure that colleagues are aware of how technology can liberate the contribu<span></span>tion of everyone, as colleagues and customers.</li>
      <li>will routinely consult with disabled colleagues, customers and experts to ensure that we understand the impact of our technology on talent management, colleague productivity and our diverse customer base.</li>
      <li>will enable built in accessibility to allow reasonable personalisation of technology by our colleagues and customers.</li>
      <li>will embed and promote a workplace adjustment process, that provides usable technology solutions for disabled colleagues, within a reasonable timeframe.</li>
      <li>will give our relevant teams the accessibility know-how needed to deliver effective business processes and adjustments for disabled colleagues and customers.</li>
      <li>will establish our performance baseline using the Accessibility Maturity Model. We will consistently go beyond minimum compliance to bring greater benefits to our business and share best practices with others.</li>
      <li>will promote a development lifecycle for our technology solutions that is based on inclusive design from definition to delivery, to minimise the cost and reputational risk triggered by retrofitting products and systems.</li>
      <li>will include accessibility as a key requirement within our procurement process and build relationships with supply partners to develop and deliver accessible prod<span></span>ucts and services.</li>
      <li>will continuously improve accessibility within our organisation, document what works and share our learning with the Technology Taskforce</li>
    </ol>
    <h4>Accessibility Maturity Model</h4>
    <p>In addition to the Accessible Technology Charter, the Technology Taskforce developed the Accessibility Maturity Model to track progress against the Charter’s ten points. An organization assesses its progress on a scale of 1 – 5:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Level 1: Informal. No documentation or process in place.</li>
      <li>Level 2: Defined. Documented but not actioned, or completed once.</li>
      <li>Level 3: Repeatable. Process established and actioned consistently. </li>
      <li>Level 4: Managed. Process monitored and improved, business as usual.</li>
      <li>Level 5: Best practice. Innovate, improve, and share.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3><span>6.6.6. </span>The Importance of Management Champions</h3>
    <p>Launching and sustaining an accessibility program requires champions from key areas across the organization. It is necessary to build champions’ understanding of accessibili<span></span>ty so they can both understand the levels of accessibility within their area of responsibili<span></span>ty and lead initiatives needed to improve capabilities.</p>
    <p>Champions within the organizations become advocates during the accessibility adoption plan, by building engaging their teams, building awareness and skills, and evangelizing accessibility. Champions will help:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Build a vision and align implementation strategies</li>
      <li>Sustain ongoing commitment and collaboration</li>
      <li>Support the programmatic integration of accessibility throughout organization process, make clear the distinction between it and discreet accessibility proj<span></span>ects.</li>
      <li>Lead the adoption of an accessibility maturity model</li>
    </ul>
    <h3><span>6.6.7. </span>Evaluating for Accessibility</h3>
    <p>Testing is critical to the design and development of accessible ICT, and practices must be built in to the organization’s approach to accessibility. The W3C recommends eval<span></span>uating early and throughout the design and development process. It is easier and less costly to find and address accessibility issues early. </p>
    <p>The following recommendations are compiled from recommendations by the W3C and other organizations:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Ensure the product or service is fit for purpose. Design for usability by people with disabilities. Consider a “born accessible” approach to design.</li>
      <li>Create reusable design and code libraries that help developers code for accessi<span></span>bility.</li>
      <li>Use quality assurance tools, methods, and protocols including accessibility evaluation tools. Human evaluation is critical to ensuring the product or service created is accessible.</li>
      <li>Perform formative, summative, and continuous evaluations. Test throughout the project lifecycle and any time new content is added or code is updated.</li>
      <li>Include people with disabilities in evaluations. </li>
      <li>there are gaps in your organization’s capabilities, use outside expert analysis and consultation until you build up in-house expertise.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3><span>6.6.8. </span>Recruiting and Hiring</h3>
    <h4>Recruiting and Including People with Disabilities</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>Include your organization’s disability inclusion statement in job postings and on the recruitment pages of your website.</li>
      <li>Posting job openings on disability-focused job boards.</li>
      <li>Ensure your organization’s recruitment website and all postings are accessible.</li>
      <li>Promote your organization at disability-focused job fairs.</li>
      <li>Ensure your facilities are accessible to applicants and employees, and that you provide reasonable accommodations including assistive technologies.</li>
      <li>Educate all employees, especially managers, on working with employees with disabilities.</li>
      <li>Ensure hiring and supervising managers understand their obligations for acces<span></span>sibility and the organizational benefits that an employee with disabilities brings to the workplace.</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Recruiting People with Digital Accessibility Skills</h4>
    <p>Carefully defined the specific skills candidates must have. Depending on the position, skill may include:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Design using CSS, HTML, and JavaScript</li>
      <li>Development using frameworks and libraries</li>
      <li>Accessibility testing using evaluation tools, keyboard testing</li>
      <li>Ability to use and test with screen reader software</li>
      <li>Ability to create, test and remediate digital files such as documents and presenta<span></span>tions</li>
      <li>Knowledge of standards such as WCAG 2.1 and PDF / UA</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Post positions on industry job sites and with professional networks such as:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>IAAP Career Center</li>
      <li>a11yjobs Digital Accessibility Job Board</li>
      <li>Professional groups</li>
      <li>Professional discussion groups and mailing lists</li>
    </ul>
    <h3><span>6.6.9. </span>Communication Management Strategies</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Marketing or external, as well as internal communications must be thoughtful<span></span>ly created to ensure that they are accessible and inclusive. Your organization should:</li>
      <li>Publish accessibility standards for communications.</li>
      <li>Provide training to communicators on using people first and plain language.</li>
      <li>Ensure the accessibility of any documents published.</li>
      <li>Ensure the accessibility of websites and all the media types it contains or refer<span></span>ences.</li>
      <li>Caption and describe videos and other time-based communications.</li>
      <li>Understand and design for how people use assistive technologies. </li>
      <li>Capitalize on the increased understanding, influence, market, and reputational potential that accessible communications provide.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3><span>6.6.10. </span>Legal &amp; Public Relations Implications</h3>
    <p>Universal design and born accessible approaches provide many benefits to the organi<span></span>zation beyond increasing the attractiveness of a product or service to a wide audience. Organizations have legal obligations to ensure their products and services, and infor<span></span>mation about them, are accessible to people with disabilities. In a large organization, its legal or risk and compliance areas should address the legal implications of accessibility. PR should consult with legal or risk and compliance before publishing accessibility in<span></span>formation about the organization. In small organizations, people in roles of responsibility should seek guidance from laws and policies on the legal and PR implications. </p>
    <p>Recommendations:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Identify and become familiar with the relevant international, regional, national, and local laws and standards.</li>
      <li>Assess your organization’s legal liability.</li>
      <li>Ensure the organization has created and is following an ICT accessibility plan.</li>
      <li>Ensure the ICT accessibility plan includes documenting how products and ser<span></span>vices meet accessibility standards.</li>
      <li>Capitalize on the positive public relations that accessibility brings your organiza<span></span>tion. </li>
    </ul>
    <h3><span>6.6.11. </span>Procurement Processes</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Best practices for procuring accessible products and services include:</li>
      <li>Verifying product accessibility claims.</li>
      <li>Verifying a vendor’s accessibility expertise and capacity.</li>
      <li>Requiring product accessibility in contractual agreements.</li>
      <li>Periodically reviewing a vendor’s product accessibility roadmap for adherence.</li>
      <li>Leveraging the organization’s procurement policies and requirements to influence vendors.</li>
    </ul>
