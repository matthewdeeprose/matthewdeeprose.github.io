Embedding accessibility within our processes is so important because we’re aiming for accessibility to be within all our IT department’s activities. What can we do to sustain our accessibility efforts? We should monitor our services, both in terms of automated tests, and as services are upgraded, redesigned, or our processes change. When you find issues it’s a great opportunity to refine training and processes. Keep working with your stakeholders, for example: raising awareness of accessibility work and its benefits. If you have set up Key Performance Indicators, check they remain relevant. Seek long-term engagement within the department. Champions networks and communities of practice can help to sustain the momentum. Keep talking to your suppliers and monitor their accessibility roadmaps. Keep track of changes to standards and legislation. Updates to the web content accessibility guidelines are around the corner. The Government will be publishing its reflections on the first year of monitoring soon, and new legislation around the world may affect your institution or offer new opportunities to out-compete your rivals. New technologies bring new opportunities. There’s always a new operating system, browser, development framework. The accessibility community is regularly sharing new, optimized practices you can benefit from. Most importantly, invite user feedback and use it to help guide improvement activities and identify areas in need of attention. Keep communicating accessibility improvements and how they benefit your user community.
