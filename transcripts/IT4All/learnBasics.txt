By learning the basics, we mean finding out what accessibility is and why it is important. The better you and your colleagues understand accessibility, the more effectively it can be implemented and promoted within your department. Deepening our understanding of web accessibility helps us to address issues more effectively. So, we could research introductory articles and videos, talk with colleagues, friends and family members with disabilities - research by the charity scope found that 40 percent of households include a member with a disability. You might find appropriate training for your role or even set up assistive technology demonstrations and let people try them out. There are hundreds of useful online resources. If you haven’t tried it yet, the Accessibility Maze is an online game that you and your colleagues can play to learn more about accessibility. You could sign up for an automated email that teaches you a little about digital accessibility each day. For example, “Ten days of accessibility” and “Web Content Accessibility Guideline (WCAG) of the day”. And there are numerous online communities and mailing lists. All these links are on the presentation support site. As you learn about accessibility - try out a few of your own websites by using a keyboard, or using a browser-based accessibility checker. For example, load up your corporate site and go through the process of ordering a prospectus using your keyboard instead of a mouse or trackpad. Or install the free accessibility insights browser plugin from Microsoft and try running a “fast pass” on a few of your sites and services. How many issues can be identified automatically and what are they?
