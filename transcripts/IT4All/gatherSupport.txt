Whatever we put into our business case we need to gather Department-wide support, which is vital to ensure accessibility is distributed across the department and sustained. Key stakeholder and management support will simplify the process of introducing or improving accessibility. Management support will help with prioritisation clashes, access to resources, and communication activities. The business case can help secure support from your stakeholders. Support for accessibility may be found among many teams within an IT department. Encourage interest by exploring the benefits to all of accessibility and how it relates to their areas. This could help to increase the enthusiasm for accessibility and create more advocates or champions. Different teams will have different actions they can take, and different existing priorities and concerns. Keeping that in mind, create opportunities to exchange information and provide support. This could be informal between interested individuals, such as chat channels and lunch gatherings, or more formal presentations to management during staff meetings or feedback sessions. Within our IT department in Southampton, we run a Digital Accessibility Community of Practice. On the support site you can find links to workshop materials we created for community accessibility events.
