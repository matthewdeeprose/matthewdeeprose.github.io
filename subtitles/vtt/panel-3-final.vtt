[Dr. Tharindu Liyanagunawardena]
OK, so thank you Matt. Currently
University of Reading at present

ec49d896-c528-472a-b8a3-5022eea4fb87
00:00:11.533 --> 00:00:15.366
does not have a digital
accessibility policy, but

bfb21966-4e77-41b9-8371-57da1355c01c
00:00:16.066 --> 00:00:19.766
it is in the final stage of
being approved.

00:00:20.633 --> 00:00:24.699
I have only been at Reading for
about seven months now in my

edbc6e49-d376-4088-a272-cd8f06129cbb
00:00:24.700 --> 00:00:28.333
current post, but this work for
accessibility... Digital

26dd8a71-477d-4e09-a248-b9e9eea0a38b
00:00:28.333 --> 00:00:31.999
accessibility policy had started
much before I joined.

8c1ce6c4-6f94-4958-be65-20a109f4c02b
00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:36.933
So there was an Online and Digital
Accessibility Working Group

dea536f8-525d-4715-9f6b-cb7c1865236a
00:00:36.933 --> 00:00:40.866
chaired by the University
Secretary. This was set up in

bc51bca7-3164-4938-9286-682a41d682bf
00:00:40.866 --> 00:00:44.799
2021 to identify how the
university needed to change to

cd78f85d-cdd1-45e7-a55e-126592d056d6
00:00:44.800 --> 00:00:49.066
become digitally accessible.
This working group consisted of

5c137536-b71b-48ce-a913-2c9cbdc0fa5f
00:00:49.066 --> 00:00:52.799
people from across the
university. I noted them down:

9e13104c-4fbe-40d2-ad1d-f8c39ca14134
00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:57.000
legal, quality, technology,
enhanced learning and teaching,

a2183ed1-1f23-4f93-8be4-a909e445d640
00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:01.333
digital technology services,
teaching and learning, diversity

a6825caf-b15e-429d-8887-9c1a30a8cd82
00:01:01.333 --> 00:01:03.066
and inclusion, disability support

5ffe017e-297b-479e-821c-0e5f30aab327

procurement, content,
digital portfolio, governance

d97b4da6-7f58-4113-a3fb-56cfb45b16c7
00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:10.000
and HR.

353d8d86-4ffe-4529-8561-beadb4ffb18b
00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:15.333
Other colleagues from various
functions were invited to attend

8545846b-8c7b-4e41-b758-428d2617518a
00:01:15.333 --> 00:01:17.533
the meetings as and when needed.

9c2499d4-a810-4f5b-bf4e-11ee382009fd
00:01:18.733 --> 00:01:22.533
While this work was ongoing, the
University received an

d0b8af02-bb4b-4e8b-88cc-0c7ffe09f269
00:01:22.533 --> 00:01:24.499

e6dc11cf-00fd-41dc-a0bd-aee7abe0b7f4
00:01:25.300 --> 00:01:30.166

Accessibility Maturity Audit

00:01:30.166 --> 00:01:31.432
with UserVision.

8e82d2b1-7aa5-4361-b7f5-9123add3742b
00:01:32.233 --> 00:01:36.499
Recommendations from these
reports, audits and the working

106b306b-4728-4142-a7a7-db1918d29f82
00:01:36.500 --> 00:01:41.133
group have been actioned and one
recommendation was to create a

297b22a4-a97b-4758-b9a5-4332c203f0b9
00:01:41.133 --> 00:01:42.199
dedicated post,

00:01:42.900 --> 00:01:46.733
a university role, Digital
Accessibility Officer, which I

581bdb1a-5a3c-4246-82f2-b96a4e89890a
00:01:46.733 --> 00:01:47.933

2ecac892-d7c8-464a-95de-301ec88a06a8
00:01:49.800 --> 00:01:53.533
The Digital Accessibility Policy
was created by the working group

e2983ebe-5397-4e0d-bb22-bee454cc2962
00:01:53.533 --> 00:01:55.099

cc60acb3-ba77-4065-b55a-8bd2ae702dd7
00:01:55.800 --> 00:01:58.700
and now it's making its way
through the proper channels

99e43d73-b224-4478-8c29-cc9d2817af80
00:01:59.500 --> 00:02:01.400
