Copilot appears on screen.

00:00:08.484 --> 00:00:10.200
The robot waves to the audience.

00:00:10.233 --> 00:00:12.543
Matthew Deeprose: Can
generative AI tools such

00:00:12.568 --> 00:00:15.866
as Copilot help us make
content more accessible?

00:00:16.233 --> 00:00:19.799
In this video I’ll cover four
scenarios I’ve used this year.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:22.999
Audio Description: The robot transforms
captions into a transcript.

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:24.292
Matthew Deeprose:
Taking a set of captions and

00:00:24.317 --> 00:00:25.000
[sparkly noise]

00:00:25.025 --> 00:00:26.932
turning it into a formatted transcript.

00:00:26.933 --> 00:00:29.632
Audio Description: The robot transforms
an image into a text.

00:00:29.633 --> 00:00:31.933
Matthew Deeprose: Writing alternative text for images.
[Sparkly Noise]

00:00:32.166 --> 00:00:34.563

[Reverberating noise]

00:00:35.636 --> 00:00:38.166
Together they transform
a podcast into a transcript.

00:00:38.766 --> 00:00:41.288
Matthew Deeprose: Transforming
a podcast into a written transcript

00:00:41.313 --> 00:00:41.709
[Sparkly noises]

00:00:41.733 --> 00:00:44.299
with speaker attribution
and formatting.

00:00:44.300 --> 00:00:48.065
Audio Description: The copilot robot
creates text, images, tables and graphs.

00:00:48.066 --> 00:00:50.874
Matthew Deeprose: And generating
sample content for use in

00:00:50.899 --> 00:00:52.332
accessibility workshops.
[Squirrely electronic noise]

00:00:52.366 --> 00:00:55.032
I’ll share how you can
recreate these scenarios...

00:00:55.266 --> 00:00:57.915
Audio Description: The background darkens.
Articles about concerns

00:00:57.940 --> 00:01:02.666
around climate sustainability and
bias appear above Copilot robot's head.

00:01:02.733 --> 00:01:03.610
Matthew Deeprose: ... and touch upon

00:01:03.635 --> 00:01:04.785
some of the challenges
[Deflated robot noise]

00:01:04.810 --> 00:01:07.866
and opportunities of using generative AI.

00:01:07.891 --> 00:01:10.381
Audio Description: The background clears.
A laptop displaying

00:01:10.406 --> 00:01:14.266
the presentation webpage
appears beside the Copilot robot.

00:01:14.290 --> 00:01:15.709
[Robot appearence chime]

00:01:15.733 --> 00:01:19.733
Matthew Deeprose: On my
website matthewdeeprose.github.io

00:01:19.866 --> 00:01:23.732
you can find the presentation
recording, a list of the prompts I share,

00:01:23.966 --> 00:01:28.099
example files I used in the presentation,
and links to further resources.

00:01:34.166 --> 00:01:37.932
Matthew Deeprose: You will also find an
enhanced transcript of the presentation

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:40.433
with images and example videos added

00:01:40.666 --> 00:01:44.666
so that if you prefer to
read the content you can.
