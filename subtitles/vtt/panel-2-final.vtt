00:00:06.166 --> 00:00:10.332
[Dr Tharindu Liyanagunawardena] Thank you.
I think first of all, we have to raise awareness of

42679078-b709-4a44-84e3-71215dd76ecd
00:00:10.333 --> 00:00:14.499
digital accessibility and the
techniques that staff can use in

ad05b313-43df-40dd-854f-9cf83df27b3e
00:00:14.500 --> 00:00:18.600
creating accessible content. Our
colleagues could be the world

e038ec06-31d3-41ba-9cec-b8dddffde640
00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:22.600
experts in their field of study,
but they may not be aware of

5427dda5-2707-4504-9737-862ed6ef5962
00:00:22.600 --> 00:00:26.100
digital accessibility, so
awareness is so important.

fabdf3b3-8267-4f98-9889-f4628bb0d4eb
00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:30.933
It is also important to show
that digital accessibility is

6e29773b-aace-44a6-a78e-0b4e71d2c4ca
00:00:30.933 --> 00:00:34.966
not an abstract concept. It's
not something out there. It's

98c34c37-3ca0-4e7e-a953-ba2a62bb6559
00:00:34.966 --> 00:00:38.832
very tangible and essential for
users. So I generally use

1b05f384-427f-45dc-8465-97c852d7c45c
00:00:38.833 --> 00:00:40.633
anecdotes and user stories.

f533c584-3fd6-42b1-a157-6dfaf407a578
00:00:43.533 --> 00:00:47.399
The next thing I would say is
use the same language as the staff.

b8233e6a-6d1a-4bf1-a8a3-b55f7e04d72b
00:00:47.866 --> 00:00:50.666
So use examples that are
relevant to them.

5f07e4e6-89c5-40b4-97a6-9f0115a38231
00:00:51.833 --> 00:00:56.166
I generally collect examples
of inaccessible content as well

6c602d8c-f277-42aa-8b7d-d0a6a7654751
00:00:56.166 --> 00:01:00.399
as good content from all over
the university and I try to use

bb27ddd0-96e7-4d90-85d7-20fad51e03e1
00:01:00.400 --> 00:01:04.633
something relevant to them so
that they can make a connection

d051df55-a06d-49e4-9700-55292f6bb7e7
00:01:06.300 --> 00:01:09.966
to what I'm talking about.

737ca1f7-a630-4416-99b8-642396269935
00:01:10.766 --> 00:01:15.966
Again I would say another
thing that would be that I use

12de9df4-70a8-47b2-a6bd-82a1b3826d77
00:01:15.966 --> 00:01:21.232
is making life easier for staff
by creating content by giving

0283f707-c088-40f2-90c9-0dfd1e8c8769
00:01:21.233 --> 00:01:24.633
accessible templates and helpful
tools.

fcc05053-fc40-4420-bc1d-323b78cfc6e8
00:01:25.633 --> 00:01:29.399
Most of all, most importantly be
there for them when they start

1c834b5d-8e95-4056-b50f-7691d2800f2b
00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:33.000
their accessibility journey.
They will need help and support

821491b2-fc2d-4f06-a8b0-89788a6f7c0a
00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:36.566
and make sure that they know
that there is support available

eb388779-3453-493f-b050-e4bd3f0b6b5e
00:01:36.566 --> 00:01:37.566
to them.

abd8a5ed-f21a-4d8f-8744-cc5a51f3db48
00:01:40.733 --> 00:01:44.133
[Lara Tompkins] Thank you Tharindu . I love
especially your example about

343ac465-49e4-4eb2-a894-46331ae753f5
00:01:44.133 --> 00:01:48.066
using story and narrative to get
buy-in from your staff.

d04171ca-f491-4e0f-b4aa-28c901f4ed86
00:01:48.066 --> 00:01:49.066
That's beautiful.

7c39417a-9b5d-46ce-8b95-65ef9f70c31e
00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:53.466
Sarah. What about you? How do
you engage your staff in creating accessible content?

386c9ad0-982c-4aa8-9f06-a30c0f840897
00:01:53.466 --> 00:01:57.066
[Sarah Whittaker] Yeah, for our staff, we
have a plethora of training actually.

2bb614cb-37cb-49e6-9156-57ffc2b9eb68
00:01:57.066 --> 00:02:00.932
So my job is basically
looking after the professional

c12cb3e4-a94e-4402-9868-45cfda82c0b7
00:02:00.933 --> 00:02:03.899
development for our 1200
faculty. And we we have

f3068de6-9309-4bca-9879-ee9fedbe27f0
00:02:03.900 --> 00:02:07.700
accessibility training, but we
actually embedded in all of our

13ec8464-cf21-4255-b352-e2cae8738f0a
00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:11.500
courses. So for example, we have
mandatory courses. So I could

6d8f00e0-883b-4388-821c-304918852f63
00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:15.433
have, I could have answered yes
to that last question. We have

fc9fa207-bbfa-40c8-b975-74ea94324cc6
00:02:15.433 --> 00:02:18.566
mandatory courses that all
faculty have to take for

c574928c-8a51-44cc-8ed3-c7640f757492
00:02:18.566 --> 00:02:19.932
Blackboard for example.

cb0be50f-3014-4039-ae75-1c91d553a462
00:02:20.066 --> 00:02:23.732
And within that we showcase
not just the accessibility

d8b84d3a-6939-4d00-aa25-e05984fe83e2
00:02:23.733 --> 00:02:27.699
features but "the why" you want to
do this. So why you want to add

1710a7c8-4583-41d1-a572-45aa45a8584d
00:02:27.700 --> 00:02:31.466
an alternative description to
the image. So, as we're teaching

c1771fe1-e560-428d-9ff2-2c351a1436ee
00:02:31.466 --> 00:02:34.932
them to add an image into
Blackboard, we teach them about

29586dbb-185e-41ef-a603-9e7c1e536be3
00:02:34.933 --> 00:02:38.666
alternative descriptions and why
you should add them. We also

8e1f1a6e-cc97-4e50-b8ec-d7a8f34a6a2f
00:02:38.666 --> 00:02:42.666
teach them things like simple
Microsoft Word training.

14b17ce0-891e-4357-b099-343d614ceef5
00:02:42.666 --> 00:02:46.199
We tell them the importance of
having having headers and sub

23c3bc0e-ba30-466e-9d34-dde62b6bd12a
00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:49.666
headers and not just trying to
create those on your own.

0d15ab28-abc6-439a-9fbb-33dab3128e60
00:02:50.266 --> 00:02:53.499
We also include in our
instructional design practise

dd9c7eb0-aa16-4225-97b6-d43e44e0bd4b
00:02:53.500 --> 00:02:56.866
a contrast colour contrast checker.
When we're looking at our

2a0f912f-ba76-4193-b543-73bd80a266ae
00:02:56.866 --> 00:03:00.799
Blackboard and we're now doing a
little bit of a transition over

15574907-e1b1-4d43-bada-111ded19c9b6
00:03:00.800 --> 00:03:04.400
to Learn Ultra. So in those
trainings we're showcasing how

f11fef06-fd06-4222-8ecf-1509f4d6eeb7
00:03:04.400 --> 00:03:08.133
Learn Ultra is a bit more
forcing you to be accessible.

9b85ece4-e6a8-4856-b878-b23dda0298b1
00:03:08.133 --> 00:03:11.666
You know, because it's more
black and white, it's minimal

f74df564-f291-4203-bc76-206d1c185ac8
00:03:11.666 --> 00:03:15.399
colours, it's easy to navigate
through where original you can

a8b287ee-ac66-4a27-ae8f-98df817bc86f
00:03:15.400 --> 00:03:19.233
get a little bit crazy and you
can, you know, the faculty have

7d212220-b433-4b90-914e-aaa6a05eaa19
00:03:19.233 --> 00:03:20.299
a lot more room to

0edb7d6e-834b-4c05-8a13-4dfd1d34d6c5
00:03:20.566 --> 00:03:23.932
mess it up, let's just say
politely. So we show them the

75c08f1f-fff2-47b1-9de6-a8d064ca347e
00:03:23.933 --> 00:03:27.433
difference and why you want to
take those practises to the

e52452e2-a757-4f21-9f78-4525f73aea1d
00:03:27.433 --> 00:03:31.233
faculty that are still using the
original LMS system. That, OK,

b014f0c3-e6a1-434a-81f1-e16969c0ad2e
00:03:31.233 --> 00:03:34.699
let's look at black and white.
Let's make sure that you're

8fe0cf9c-1290-4fdd-a1e2-3dc15ead8a7e
00:03:34.700 --> 00:03:38.200
using the headers and the
subtitles there as well, because

35b9bdfc-3b6d-4d2b-ab86-18067520d4f0
00:03:38.200 --> 00:03:41.466
if you have a student who's
using, you know, a reader,

949dd872-49cf-4ead-9dfb-d93cbfb80ce2
00:03:41.466 --> 00:03:44.899
they're going to need that
support so not to disadvantage

8d682f0b-4dae-42d9-9c51-da0717353478
00:03:44.900 --> 00:03:48.033
your students. So we try to
embed it into all of the

7b475845-0190-4133-948a-d6cd50f96704
00:03:48.033 --> 00:03:50.433
professional development that we
provide.

09c329e2-0c5e-4d98-b088-8676fa76340f
00:03:50.700 --> 00:03:50.733
And then as well we we do
flyers, we do, you know, tips,

0c594dfa-05c4-4d37-b382-b8db39ee0f9d
00:03:50.733 --> 00:03:57.599
we have a lot of EdTech tips
that we send out, we send out on

e6c1a2c9-e747-4efb-a6fe-4077bdbb6107
00:03:57.600 --> 00:04:01.000
a weekly basis and we embed it
[accessibility] into those tips as well.

0d51ab1c-2ca5-4442-be37-964cec203268
00:04:05.733 --> 00:04:09.199
[Lara Tompkins] Thank you Sarah.
Yeah, I love that both of you are really

bd6374a4-f88a-4bb1-a673-563c4499cc5d
00:04:09.200 --> 00:04:12.933
honing in on using visualisation
as a tool to really drive it

c1d08501-85a5-4f9d-8f42-e152d6673b01
00:04:12.933 --> 00:04:16.833
home to your staff and get them
invested. One more question, and

cf9af140-9531-4358-bd03-ed59776b28f5
00:04:16.833 --> 00:04:17.833
that is

75aa7243-09ce-4b3a-acfc-54920b7b431f
00:04:17.966 --> 00:04:21.432
for Esin and Terry. Do you have
any tips for countering

ebb7d9b3-50ec-49d0-8c30-67cca3e738e6
00:04:21.433 --> 00:04:25.166
arguments like "I don't
have any disabled students" and

7b135bc4-fe5d-481e-9ba0-dc19c4fe10e3
00:04:25.166 --> 00:04:26.666
"I don't have time for this"?

957a62c2-47df-4a82-8971-778603f4ef73
00:04:27.700 --> 00:04:28.900
Again, we'll start with Esin.

b073a7de-a9a5-460f-b442-d6d394ce969f
00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:34.166
[Dr Esin Caglayan] Yeah, sure. For the
question, but "I don't have any

2704b141-581e-4812-adf3-5e11301b2e9b
00:04:34.166 --> 00:04:38.732
disabled students". My counter
argument would be you may not be

be1726a9-946b-4cac-a733-10b0ba50c4b2
00:04:38.733 --> 00:04:39.733
sure of that.

38c1809d-5e8b-4959-9f3d-823bf18db0de
00:04:40.400 --> 00:04:44.600
There may be students with
certain disabilities like

c641f599-1582-4b1e-90b2-b914309e4e92
00:04:44.600 --> 00:04:49.033
dyslexia which they themselves
are not aware of. Also there

e87f999d-27ab-4d8d-bce9-5db0dba94571
00:04:49.033 --> 00:04:53.599
are some students who hesitate
to submit an official report to

ea33e716-9c71-47d9-adbf-f9009c86f678
00:04:53.600 --> 00:04:58.066
their instructors or to their
faculty, or share anything about

8246b437-fc73-4d38-9618-f9511c2d2e8f
00:04:58.066 --> 00:05:02.066
their disabilities. So we may
not be sure of you know,

ea241d43-d9c1-4a8d-9de4-1d29938beeff
00:05:02.066 --> 00:05:05.799
different learning styles,
different preferences or

6eb9ec4b-d40a-40b7-8e6e-8d047535aaf1
00:05:05.800 --> 00:05:10.100
disabilities. That's why as
instructors, we should take the

2c49bad7-2780-44be-a915-7d7de2d688ef
00:05:10.100 --> 00:05:10.666
lead and

383e6c9f-8762-4cff-8a3b-c5c23125dd88
00:05:10.766 --> 00:05:14.566
what we do is we just empower
instructors through training

a4a7d344-9f3c-4328-a43b-f1631d822ac2
00:05:14.566 --> 00:05:18.232
programmes. I created an in
house twelve module professional

ffd962ae-e99b-4920-bb49-5ccbfbe53788
00:05:18.233 --> 00:05:22.099
development course for our
instructors and one of the

8f9c38a6-308b-4107-ad10-b4096aad7689
00:05:22.100 --> 00:05:26.066
modules is only for preparing
digitally accessible materials.

0754a7fa-056a-4395-8c3c-42c5893320d5
00:05:26.933 --> 00:05:30.499
And another module is about
alternative assessments

2640fa4b-06de-4591-a88b-c30f425ae2f8
00:05:30.500 --> 00:05:33.900
actually, which aims to
encourage instructors to

f05f66d7-d38d-4d33-9824-3966cad9dc92
00:05:33.900 --> 00:05:38.033
incorporate various types of
assessments, not only tests or

0dc9762f-b231-47ce-aeb6-933247ea870d
00:05:38.033 --> 00:05:42.133
written assignment submissions
but other options which are

00bb5063-533b-4f3c-a8b2-842bf54cf741
00:05:42.133 --> 00:05:46.066
available through multimedia as
well. And we also have a

a4f03ef1-403b-4116-b0ea-3bc00dd67cd4
00:05:46.066 --> 00:05:50.132
community of practise activity,
which we called TLCoP,

4c2d7ed6-ed77-434e-94eb-2c5dccdc83cd
00:05:50.133 --> 00:05:54.333
Community of Practise. And we
encourage instructors to share

25df9bf8-568f-48ba-bee6-37b0d505ccb6
00:05:54.333 --> 00:05:57.566
their good practises. You know,
peer learning

6e81e0d7-8fe1-43ae-8ea3-7181e6e2d955
00:05:57.700 --> 00:06:00.933
is sometimes more
influential.

dc8728b7-35ad-4184-9a36-da4e0bb3fcff
00:06:02.166 --> 00:06:06.432
Recently one of our instructors,
for example from the engineering

88ddb7c0-7f79-4ca8-8eeb-c3e52ae2d980
00:06:06.433 --> 00:06:10.233
faculty shared an application
which she developed herself.

0c221e6d-b23c-4570-8340-cc82864221ec
00:06:11.833 --> 00:06:16.133
This application aims to
turn a PDF, a static PDF

a4e0c748-e6fe-4f95-a355-6a809b4bbc20
00:06:16.133 --> 00:06:20.299
document, into an animated
PowerPoint presentation. And

5ee75d16-d94c-4568-accb-962a9cb1fa99
00:06:20.300 --> 00:06:24.833
this was a particularly useful
for online sessions where the

be781461-53ba-45ba-96ec-6b51c871f1e5
00:06:24.833 --> 00:06:29.566
instructor is screen sharing you
know the whole PDF rather than

d0ba8eec-bcef-4261-b97b-72b188e1f72e
00:06:29.566 --> 00:06:33.966
doing that you know, practically
preparing your PowerPoint

318180d3-69ef-4741-ad75-9dba3a880b34
00:06:33.966 --> 00:06:38.032
presentation with animations.
That has been found very

00:06:38.033 --> 00:06:41.666
practical and welcomed by the
other instructors.

22e7a37d-e726-4bbf-ae64-e7fbf4b7bc22
00:06:42.466 --> 00:06:46.799
Also we prepare templates...
I mean digitally

986f34e2-7422-4845-bdfe-6979937b7a31
00:06:46.800 --> 00:06:51.533
accessible templates for our
instructors, ready made, just as

8bf3a1ea-bcdf-45c4-8d9e-32cbbdc4022b
00:06:51.533 --> 00:06:56.166
a counter argument for "I don't
have time for this". So these

05a7d9dd-9b6b-498b-9798-c05059b21cec
00:06:56.166 --> 00:07:00.032
templates are for course
syllabi, some assessment

8ce25a78-8b4b-4e71-b3ac-ade6f56c5d76
00:07:00.033 --> 00:07:04.599
instructions. You know,
those kinds of templates that

e570b103-6af8-40e5-a333-9deac2e3e755
00:07:04.600 --> 00:07:08.966
can be used across various
faculties or courses. So the

1dea4804-9d22-41e7-95b6-6e399f3dc347
00:07:08.966 --> 00:07:12.966
instructors themselves just
customise and use them

2181328b-aa82-4f91-a289-b401c3b06959
00:07:12.966 --> 00:07:15.232
in their own courses as they
wish.

00:07:16.566 --> 00:07:17.566
Thank you.

c07c1123-87e4-4abf-9125-bedd1e5be113
00:07:19.166 --> 00:07:20.166
Thank you Esin.

fd1e04eb-493b-4b54-9612-7b3ccadabe2e
00:07:20.700 --> 00:07:21.700
And Terry.

62db7eb0-d132-4ff7-a8d4-6e04ddc93c1b
00:07:22.200 --> 00:07:24.566
What about you? What tips do you
have for counting these types of

e13bd799-81b2-4be7-b5b6-18cd309e7c7c
00:07:24.566 --> 00:07:25.566
arguments?

00:07:26.333 --> 00:07:31.599
[Terry Green] OK, so in Ontario there's the
this thing called the AODA Act,

0dc577d6-7623-4f8c-8689-2e684eebfe4d
00:07:31.600 --> 00:07:36.933
the Accessibility for Ontarians
with Disabilities Act and its

d8b4d0db-7bdf-4758-8d12-be7bae450e30
00:07:36.933 --> 00:07:38.199
goal is to make

2da22586-30a7-4027-8371-514f3fa96e0f
00:07:38.866 --> 00:07:43.099
accessibility widespread and
commonplace. And you must be in

b44e1667-fe46-4704-8ecc-153ecaa0dca2
00:07:43.100 --> 00:07:46.833
compliance. It has some
principles, the principles of

82a80941-d34a-4b22-98c5-2436457a40ec
00:07:46.833 --> 00:07:49.966
dignity, independence,
integration and equal

be504af8-f425-4564-a622-39cf75f44f5d
00:07:49.966 --> 00:07:52.666
opportunity. So if someone said
to me,

b08fc9e7-51d4-484b-8674-a06d7598f3a3
00:07:53.933 --> 00:07:57.233
"but I don't have any disabled students
and I don't have any time for this",

62835ff4-ab4c-45af-a460-f95a7864c3d2
00:07:57.233 --> 00:08:00.566
I can say, "Tough luck, pal. It's
the law and you have to do it".

b3cc1db1-206c-414a-9717-a3a5b5a46bcc
00:08:00.566 --> 00:08:03.366
So, it's kind of a no brainer
for us here in Ontario.
