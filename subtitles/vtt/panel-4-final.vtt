00:00:06.300 --> 00:00:09.366
[James Northridge] I guess the way I approach this question is,
is more so to talk

9352a5fa-2724-4e7d-908c-e7d29194fdb7
00:00:09.366 --> 00:00:12.199
about the things that we're
actually doing really well. So

02d100b9-0196-492d-9469-2a75245f3622
00:00:12.200 --> 00:00:15.033
we've got phenomenal senior
leadership  and we have our,

0fbb59b9-1b81-4b8e-a5e4-9be13831656f
00:00:15.033 --> 00:00:17.833
our registrar / deputy President
as our project sponsor. He

0959aa52-31e4-4d61-b3a2-c973f7b4345a
00:00:17.833 --> 00:00:20.833
pushes quite a lot. We've been
relatively well funded since I

8db42dd2-0687-49e6-b3da-1d68cb3fddda
00:00:20.833 --> 00:00:23.833
took up the post. I
started the project about a year

73af930a-5b61-4861-bca5-b3228b2ef30d
00:00:23.833 --> 00:00:25.066
and a half ago and I guess

0fe98eb9-13b0-4589-89f3-dbbdf6dde3b5
00:00:26.233 --> 00:00:28.933
in thinking about... that it's
about "how do we keep that

cfa536b5-b9f3-4edb-bd51-1aabaf8160f8
00:00:28.933 --> 00:00:32.033
momentum"?
And so, so we have strong leadership, we

4824c578-5a15-473e-8194-4b2e360735cc
00:00:32.033 --> 00:00:34.899
have good momentum. We've
relatively good funding. But I

0e4968e2-a34d-48ef-804f-787caab718c6
00:00:34.900 --> 00:00:37.566
guess one of the the core
challenges for me are what

c4d9b5cd-844b-40f4-a9d2-b126bd75a6ea
00:00:37.566 --> 00:00:40.666
happens when "the shine" goes
off the project?

b1955081-0d85-44c0-b843-b897d959f16c
00:00:40.666 --> 00:00:43.732
What happens when the registrar says,
"you know what, I've given you

353106b5-8b33-40ff-90ab-84fe8c8afbc1
00:00:43.733 --> 00:00:46.599
enough of my time now, you need
to fly solo". And I

7e981641-aa13-4fea-b2c2-d659b4a71053
00:00:46.600 --> 00:00:50.900
suppose my concern is
we're at that sort of tipping point.

bc557be3-1284-4de0-82ea-7e8ef7492e48
00:00:51.033 --> 00:00:54.599
Have we built enough momentum and
buy in? Have we got enough

a4899f8d-33d5-44a8-8161-eef0fe40407a
00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:58.200
staff on board to actually keep
them on board? We're doing

6265189a-3398-4da8-a2a2-3b92531b7d4c
00:00:58.200 --> 00:01:00.366
things relatively well I would
think.

b7c0a185-c578-4b8b-9988-8ef732115c6f
00:01:01.166 --> 00:01:04.566
But my my other concern is that
staff were coming to that point

301d8221-f8db-4b81-aee5-fc30a845b58f
00:01:04.566 --> 00:01:07.632
of thinking. "I think I've done
enough. I've used the

51805691-872d-4b62-9bb8-d82bccee6913
00:01:07.633 --> 00:01:10.866
accessory checker, I've checked
my content, we're doing good

821ce3da-312d-4450-b7b8-6acec45aefc9
00:01:10.866 --> 00:01:14.099
with Ally."
I have that reservation. That's

890b27c8-1bdb-4afd-aef5-f3b1581eca19
00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:17.233
certainly one of the core
challenges and what we try to do

98804b51-24bb-4fdc-8a06-05feb2503d0d
00:01:17.233 --> 00:01:19.966
to mitigate it, I suppose, is to
embed accessibility and

a49671c9-3d6e-476b-b518-e74bd0b462d5
00:01:19.966 --> 00:01:23.166
universal design into our new
five-year strategic plan.

3eff2ec3-9f08-49c1-96f1-3ba4534da36d
00:01:23.166 --> 00:01:26.299
And again, one of the challenges
there is, it's a nice to have challenge.

b9488ed8-6af1-4130-aa1d-860c4250a3ea
00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:29.300
It's in there. It's
certainly been called out, but

4ce04ca0-a21a-438a-a266-555c72925c76
00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:31.233
are we going to put enough
behind it,

167d94ee-4868-472a-8a7b-49503e394db7
00:01:31.466 --> 00:01:34.032
actually resourced  to
move it forward? So that's

d5305649-e7b9-49e2-a300-0cd6a8af116b
00:01:34.033 --> 00:01:36.566
probably some of the core
challenges for us at the moment.

9e4df43a-4549-40f3-8fe9-98bd5dd4a1be
00:01:36.566 --> 00:01:39.066
Even though they sound like
positives, my concern is that

d0f0da31-71af-4113-b99b-a00bd92f7960
00:01:39.066 --> 00:01:41.799
they're going to spin in the
next, you know, 6 to 8 months if

dd4ed17c-c935-4743-9bcc-e8550ee87736
00:01:41.800 --> 00:01:44.066
if we don't build enough
momentum in the short term.

967cd7bb-fded-4159-8813-e865e87b1735
00:01:45.300 --> 00:01:49.166
[Sarah Whittaker] The biggest challenge is awareness
and also buy in. We do

ca35fa89-0ae3-45cd-a3c5-12c048e23e8c
00:01:49.166 --> 00:01:52.632
not have a policy. We do not
have a law like we have in

8efbf009-ded2-44fe-ae59-33ef95326ed6
00:01:52.633 --> 00:01:56.633
Canada. I'm from Ontario as well
and we don't have that here in

589bcf7a-c38c-4b65-9a86-dc11788a7d32
00:01:56.633 --> 00:02:00.566
the UAE. However, I've been in
the UAE for almost 15 years and

c41a1066-f4bc-4b15-9d11-0eb75f3c3d85
00:02:00.566 --> 00:02:04.632
it's changed a lot since I first
came into the country and first

78dfd098-74a4-46c8-96ac-d466d804c99c
00:02:04.633 --> 00:02:08.733
started working in my institute.
So we have over 25,000 students.

51babbfd-129c-48f2-a143-14bf82f22954
00:02:08.733 --> 00:02:12.733
We have to have accessibility.
It's just we know that there are

b0d83e04-3aed-4a43-a168-4f1e0bd13559
00:02:12.733 --> 00:02:16.399
students who need our support.
They never get turned away.

e5bb4b7b-b6be-454c-a331-d7dd24d8943c
00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:20.533
We always accept, but then it's
the challenge of providing

9fdeb71b-2f0f-4666-bc6b-1899683782d8
00:02:20.533 --> 00:02:24.699
the support and especially with
students who are having visible

90e2235c-68fd-42b2-a727-7df7efe7cd36
00:02:24.700 --> 00:02:28.266
needs. So here in the UAE
recently in the last four or

d7905ae2-a93f-4a05-90f1-d68570b7f9ac
00:02:28.266 --> 00:02:32.366
five years, they have created a
site, a government site and they

ecfdc573-c75b-4ec3-bc68-27a64d55404d
00:02:32.366 --> 00:02:36.466
have started pushing from the
government to provide support to

86036a5d-63a2-4c0e-a685-072d067b9792
00:02:36.566 --> 00:02:40.599
all students. And there's like a
a policy of "Leave no Emirati Behind."

ad325c91-5ff8-44d7-844e-da1dd40d9324
00:02:40.600 --> 00:02:44.533
They're called "people of
determination" in this country.

4927f464-2971-4cff-a489-23feb55664a8
00:02:44.666 --> 00:02:47.199
So, it's a very positive spin
about it.

a31d72c5-0ceb-403b-8432-83a550fa82d8
00:02:47.500 --> 00:02:50.966
So it is changing, which is
great. However, is it changing

8071ee2c-274c-4f0c-b565-4eda54441aae
00:02:50.966 --> 00:02:54.066
fast enough? And at the
educational level and in our

74bf2633-1243-4e45-897e-1ce22ee667c1
00:02:54.066 --> 00:02:57.732
institute we have, you know, so
many students and we, I know,

954d224c-cee6-43ff-a917-cd9153d7c147
00:02:57.733 --> 00:03:01.199
for example, if they need
support for exams, we have final

33f9744b-6a9c-4057-b7e1-6030d62c26b0
00:03:01.200 --> 00:03:04.600
exams coming up. We have a
student on the campus that I'm

3e44d3c3-21e1-4f92-a49d-87336c23a74b
00:03:04.600 --> 00:03:08.200
in who needs a reader. So we
have somebody dedicated sitting

f7aa28ea-a647-44f6-b066-e74b47ae9d8a
00:03:08.200 --> 00:03:11.733
there reading the exam out for
her. So that's great. But we

7ff4f782-e125-423f-b83c-200459f72625
00:03:11.733 --> 00:03:15.433
also have some amazing tools and
unfortunately the councillors

dfa44067-75d5-4a72-8df4-bf6cd79a3653
00:03:15.433 --> 00:03:18.066
are not aware of those tools
because they're

24c55aa6-b223-49d5-a068-2343878e9d4a
00:03:18.233 --> 00:03:21.933
their counsellors, they're not
accessibility experts and we

fbbc04c5-5863-497e-b2f4-4c00ac62c7f7
00:03:21.933 --> 00:03:25.333
don't have a specific
accessibility team, which I wish

73febe98-6f5f-48a5-b4cf-2e50a05952bb
00:03:25.333 --> 00:03:29.233
we had. We need, we need to hire
and get our team together. So

47b446ba-431e-42b3-a5d4-ba072330a340
00:03:29.233 --> 00:03:32.866
hopefully as the government
moves forward and and the push

9d1993dd-9d4f-4fbd-966d-fa2b3e931db3
00:03:32.866 --> 00:03:36.766
gets stronger, those things will
come into place. They're very

50139953-646f-41d4-a5b8-494fa6b83d7c
00:03:36.766 --> 00:03:40.732
good at technology here and very
good at supporting the people.

b446e64b-4858-4bba-8d4a-9d2f8b91b089
00:03:40.733 --> 00:03:45.399
So hopefully, yeah, it will kind
of have a good domino effect for us.
