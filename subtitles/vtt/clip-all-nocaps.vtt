00:00:01.100 --> 00:00:05.065
[James Northridge] ...we brought in four interns
last year, student interns that worked with

00:00:05.066 --> 00:00:08.465
us for ten weeks in the summer and
we took in twenty modules across the

00:00:08.466 --> 00:00:11.565
university and we had the
students review those modules

00:00:11.566 --> 00:00:14.932
for accessibility and it was a
really, really good success.

00:00:14.933 --> 00:00:18.032
We saw that the [accessibility] scores
jumped quite high in terms of

00:00:18.033 --> 00:00:21.165
those twenty modules and
also we were building capacity

00:00:21.166 --> 00:00:24.732
within those twenty staff.
So, the instructors or staff that

00:00:24.733 --> 00:00:28.799
ran those modules or courses
were then really brought into

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:31.765
that and we kind of brought them on the journey.
They had to meet the students every

00:00:31.767 --> 00:00:34.832
two weeks and we then did a showcase
back to the staff in terms of

00:00:34.833 --> 00:00:36.266
what the students learned.

00:00:37.434 --> 00:00:41.065
[Sharon Austin] For the faculty,
we ask them to

00:00:42.166 --> 00:00:46.699
show students about the
alternative formats because many

00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:51.499
students use it to, for example,
change a PowerPoint to a PDF so

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:56.165
that they can do their learning
on a mobile basis, and faculty

00:00:56.166 --> 00:01:00.465
are unaware of the convenience
of this. So we educate the

00:01:00.466 --> 00:01:04.932
faculty about the multimodal
opportunities that alternative

00:01:04.933 --> 00:01:06.099
formats offer.

00:01:06.934 --> 00:01:10.565
[Dr Tharindu Liyanagunawardena] I think
first of all, we have to raise awareness of

00:01:10.566 --> 00:01:14.732
digital accessibility and the
techniques that staff can use in

00:01:14.733 --> 00:01:18.832
creating accessible content. Our
colleagues could be the world

00:01:18.833 --> 00:01:22.832
experts in their field of study,
but they may not be aware of

00:01:22.833 --> 00:01:26.332
digital accessibility, so
awareness is so important.

00:01:27.234 --> 00:01:31.165
It is also important to show
that digital accessibility is

00:01:31.166 --> 00:01:35.199
not an abstract concept. It's
not something "out there".

00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:39.065
It's very tangible and essential for
users. So, I generally use

00:01:39.066 --> 00:01:40.865
anecdotes and user stories.

00:01:42.401 --> 00:01:43.699
[Dr Esin Caglayan] ...but just as
you said, I mean

00:01:43.801 --> 00:01:47.765
Instructors are critical
at this point, I believe.

00:01:47.867 --> 00:01:51.765
That's why we share these
materials with the instructors

00:01:51.766 --> 00:01:55.965
and ask them to disseminate them
through their course sites on the

00:01:55.966 --> 00:02:01.265
LMS and also mention them,
highlight them, during their courses.

00:02:01.333 --> 00:02:04.965
You know, it has a
better influence on the

00:02:04.966 --> 00:02:09.399
students, and teachers / instructors.
They have direct communication.

00:02:09.400 --> 00:02:11.899
So, what the
instructor says is more

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:15.665
important than a general
announcement or a flyer, I believe.

00:02:15.733 --> 00:02:18.632
[Sarah Whittaker] ...all
faculty have to take for

00:02:18.633 --> 00:02:19.999
Blackboard for example.

00:02:20.134 --> 00:02:23.799
And within that we showcase
not just the accessibility

00:02:23.800 --> 00:02:27.765
features but "the why" you want to
do this. So why you want to add

00:02:27.766 --> 00:02:31.532
an alternative description to
the image. So, as we're teaching

00:02:31.533 --> 00:02:34.999
them to add an image into
Blackboard, we teach them about

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:38.732
alternative descriptions and why
you should add them. We also

00:02:38.733 --> 00:02:42.732
teach them things like simple
Microsoft Word training.

00:02:42.733 --> 00:02:46.265
We tell them the importance of
having having headers and sub

00:02:46.266 --> 00:02:49.732
headers and not just trying to
create those on your own.

00:02:50.634 --> 00:02:56.399
[Terry Green] OK, so in Ontario there's
this thing called the AODA Act,

00:02:56.400 --> 00:03:01.732
the Accessibility for Ontarians
with Disabilities Act and its

00:03:01.733 --> 00:03:05.299
goal is to make accessibility widespread
and commonplace.

00:03:05.367 --> 00:03:07.399
And you must be in compliance.

00:03:07.400 --> 00:03:11.132
It has some
principles, the principles of

00:03:11.133 --> 00:03:14.665
dignity, independence,
integration and equal opportunity.

00:03:14.666 --> 00:03:16.865
So, if someone said to me...

00:03:18.233 --> 00:03:21.532
"but I don't have any disabled students
and I don't have any time for this",

00:03:21.533 --> 00:03:24.865
I can say, "Tough luck, pal. It's
the law and you have to do it".

00:03:24.866 --> 00:03:27.666
So, it's kind of a "no brainer"
for us here in Ontario.
