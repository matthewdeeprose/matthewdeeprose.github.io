00:00:06.033 --> 00:00:10.033
[Matthew Deeprose] ... to raise student
awareness about alternative formats?

afc9f939-36b4-4e97-95d7-acdca3bfee3e
00:00:11.066 --> 00:00:16.132
[Sharon Austin] Thank you.
We take a two-pronged approach.

6f95ad85-680b-4031-b2e9-74bad59f696d
00:00:16.133 --> 00:00:21.433
We address the students through a special
organisation called the

91ad33eb-03dd-406e-b6d4-af9641948dcf
00:00:21.433 --> 00:00:27.033
Advanced Digital Learning Centre that is
meant just for students and for

50b81fb3-e6aa-428c-a932-e409599ef717
00:00:27.033 --> 00:00:32.566
them we show them about Ally and
its convenience for them.

99483e5e-5f4e-4092-be00-a2b4591128dd
00:00:32.566 --> 00:00:35.099
For the faculty, we ask them to

df1fefe0-f927-442e-af40-15a260f08db5
00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:40.733
shows students about the
alternative formats because many

364edc16-e93f-4878-9733-ecfbd5487aed
00:00:40.733 --> 00:00:45.533
students use it to, for example,
change a PowerPoint to a PDF so

627109ad-56c5-45ce-a6da-73ba34662017
00:00:45.533 --> 00:00:50.199
that they can do their learning
on a mobile basis, and faculty

79b6eac1-c4ff-42d9-97f0-efc72fa23917
00:00:50.200 --> 00:00:54.500
are unaware of the convenience
of this. So we educate the

43013db8-8084-4246-872c-a36eb9b873ef
00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:58.966
faculty about the multimodal
opportunities that alternative

85ec071f-c727-4b4c-9f42-750d5d3eb0a4
00:00:58.966 --> 00:01:00.799
formats offer. Thank you.

b101afa7-592e-403d-8981-3d5f6f98364b
00:01:02.266 --> 00:01:05.966
[Matthew Deeprose] Thank you very much,
Sharon. I could see definitely

6c199658-6b19-455c-9188-4cfec2c857a2
00:01:05.966 --> 00:01:09.299
asking the faculty, the
instructors, to give that

496ebb5d-5db3-455f-b11f-f9e1881443cb
00:01:09.300 --> 00:01:13.300
information in addition to what
you're doing centrally, I imagine

d7cb8161-003c-4a92-9b3c-3c32060733d8
00:01:13.300 --> 00:01:17.033
is very powerful. Esin, if I
could turn to you, what does

0115429d-553b-4159-9606-dad5184ae770
00:01:17.033 --> 00:01:20.299
your institution do to raise
student awareness about

3211f90f-a38b-4ddd-aa2c-14cc03cff826
00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:21.533
alternative formats?

0ed80337-6f15-4926-9455-e99bbe7985f1
00:01:22.566 --> 00:01:27.566
[Dr Esin Caglayan] Thank you, Matthew.
As you mentioned we are not an Ally user... yet.

b7fed440-e7ec-4aa7-a0fe-87d3afa31c03
00:01:27.566 --> 00:01:32.199
So what we do is
we create informative

ccf00e2d-d828-464c-aef5-dd4e8cf8e44f
00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:37.133
posters or leaflets and short
videos and share them with our

7afd7914-d937-4fbb-b35d-b8c7d4724abc
00:01:37.133 --> 00:01:41.333
our students on our community
page on the LMS - our

a215dd42-0315-4e18-bb02-c48d9132f4ee
00:01:41.333 --> 00:01:46.199
Blackboard LMS and we also have
a social media account. So we

a37a94bd-00b9-4e14-a92d-0dacaf26fa2c
00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:50.900
prepare, we share the, we post
them on a regular basis.

eb802942-a800-4cea-b22e-3804003bef7c
00:01:50.900 --> 00:01:52.200
But just as you said,
I mean

d5f79f98-7236-43c4-9cec-622ea7630aef
00:01:52.300 --> 00:01:56.266
instructors are critical
at this point, I believe.

a7176f38-2820-42b3-a61a-74203d14264c
00:01:56.366 --> 00:02:00.266
That's why we share these
materials with the instructors

7e574090-1198-4c59-b9a7-248d37e1667b
00:02:00.266 --> 00:02:04.466
and ask them to disseminate them
through their course sites on the

f95012c6-d3ba-44e3-877f-3b1824ac9bde
00:02:04.466 --> 00:02:07.966
LMS and also mention them,
highlight them, during their

206277b8-6af9-4093-bac9-527fee5c26f6
00:02:07.966 --> 00:02:08.966
courses.

f7661ddb-02b8-4f0e-8b3b-a02f62baf847
00:02:09.833 --> 00:02:13.466
You know, it has a
better influence on the

3159a197-0b8c-4e57-8a5e-5d163e86ec07
00:02:13.466 --> 00:02:17.299
students, and teachers /
instructors. They have direct

28dc3e08-bd5d-4a4c-92e1-df95654cfffd
00:02:17.300 --> 00:02:20.500
communication. So what the
instructor says is more

4e249777-5813-49c6-8617-1734acb3d08b
00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:23.666
important than a general
announcement or a flyer,

0471d3f5-32fd-46bf-bc71-b6fc8a2c4190
00:02:23.666 --> 00:02:24.666
I believe.

074eaf10-fc77-40d5-9866-a7e3e4ca8a28
00:02:26.300 --> 00:02:29.966
Brilliant, thank you very much
Esin. So, there's definitely

e68f9f30-fcbd-4b51-bcb3-3a898542e500
00:02:29.966 --> 00:02:33.632
some common themes there. And
I'd also invite both Sharon and

0baedf09-4edb-44a5-a775-66e9f0f31e9c
00:02:33.633 --> 00:02:37.499
Esin, if you happen to have any
publicly available links of how

ef56cd1a-2129-47b0-b782-97c157da395f
00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:40.966
you promote these sorts of
things to students, if you have

bc0785da-e886-4b9b-89d2-95167fb9a7ef
00:02:40.966 --> 00:02:44.566
a moment to post them in the
chat or if not later perhaps on

fc713434-4adf-4a6c-9fbb-5c3b344683db
00:02:44.566 --> 00:02:48.132
the ally community site.
I'm sure they'll be a lot of

670aebf3-99ea-4115-b046-27145cedb71d
00:02:48.133 --> 00:02:51.866
interest in that. So going to
turn to our next question, which

e1e4a12f-6f8b-4b38-8285-b3964a228bf2
00:02:51.866 --> 00:02:54.566
we're going to ask Terry first and
then Sharon.

e16cfc15-6028-496f-9dd9-d28f0629c0f3
00:02:56.466 --> 00:03:00.332
Terry, do you have any tips and
strategies to appealing to all

fddbf683-97c6-4e3e-af23-4d74a4b63bed
00:03:00.333 --> 00:03:03.999
students? Because of course
these alternative formats, they

5e87bcce-3445-4fa4-8603-11d392177c96
00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:07.233
can be very beneficial to
students who might have an

d0ef203c-8600-4f2f-99db-59abee3fac99
00:03:07.233 --> 00:03:11.033
impairment or disability, but
they could really be beneficial

028f1d9e-c87e-43f5-a930-f285b063ebd0
00:03:11.033 --> 00:03:14.433
to all of us. Over to you, Terry
from Trent University.

c8306bad-7cc8-4c47-a411-1d4013c178a0
00:03:15.500 --> 00:03:18.266
[Terry Greene] Yeah, thanks. Hi everybody.
Can you hear me OK?

917225db-ad72-48e5-a800-320167be213e
00:03:19.333 --> 00:03:20.333
[Matthew Deeprose] Yes,

03e46af2-2903-486b-b19a-caada78b58c1
00:03:20.466 --> 00:03:21.966
[Terry Green] Thank you. Awesome.

71f97359-0ad1-46eb-8df3-28a349ad1b13
00:03:23.433 --> 00:03:27.499
So I'm an e-learning
designer and we

eacfe288-d356-4f4d-8f38-aff86a3847c3
00:03:28.800 --> 00:03:32.500
work with faculty to develop
fully online, mostly

9c8c7cf5-45b4-4f98-8c74-006fa8da3127
00:03:32.500 --> 00:03:37.200
asynchronous courses. And so our
tips are basically we use UDL

35406013-c6a5-4be3-89f2-966cc4e55e98
00:03:37.200 --> 00:03:41.666
principles, Universal Design for
Learning. I'm not sure how

8891e3cd-de31-4089-9126-7e594cd8c5cd
00:03:41.666 --> 00:03:45.966
broadly known those are where
you are, but we embed

b53fc939-e635-433d-bb1c-afd66c28248b
00:03:45.966 --> 00:03:50.599
those in our practise and the
principles are that you provide

8b53c619-9899-43bf-9a8a-b4d140570ddb
00:03:50.600 --> 00:03:55.266
multiple means of engagement,
multiple means of representation

86eafb5d-df05-4b8f-9207-8ced79b859f4
00:03:55.266 --> 00:03:59.199
and multiple means of
expression. So basically that means

47e5ef05-1f05-4711-83e2-a6c91aa267e7
00:03:59.333 --> 00:04:03.133
in the content you deliver, the
activities that the students are

34d905fe-ff7a-404f-a1fa-f09db2c9f5cd
00:04:03.133 --> 00:04:04.433
expected to do, and

deb3b7d1-8898-4803-a028-88261e61ad3d
00:04:06.233 --> 00:04:11.099
what they produce for assessment
for marks - it all has variety and

306ed9d1-1348-4fc2-b41d-c3bde6fcd6cc
00:04:11.100 --> 00:04:15.833
multiple ways to go about it. So
that like for example multiple

4aea1281-2d5e-4b0e-aae1-1a9b35dba411
00:04:15.833 --> 00:04:20.633
means of expression. You can say
you can respond to this with an

c6f29aec-e8ff-4a45-a813-0880759539f7
00:04:20.633 --> 00:04:25.299
essay, but you could also create
a podcast, you could also do a

a3a0be0e-a690-4561-925c-a07c005f75b8
00:04:25.300 --> 00:04:30.033
video, it's up to you.
And that is basically the

69889663-6f3e-479d-9139-bc055f978b85
00:04:30.033 --> 00:04:34.699
answer to the question for me.
It would appeal to all students

109c7215-5935-4340-a9ee-f0b08f568132
00:04:34.700 --> 00:04:36.666
universally. So, the the whole

4a7dcd50-ae81-40f4-96b5-4addd1a828e4
00:04:36.766 --> 00:04:39.866
idea of universal design for
learning is really embedded in

6c3cd792-23ba-44f6-b32a-770b5caf69a0
00:04:39.866 --> 00:04:42.932
our practise here and I have a
link if you haven't seen the

72f7fd71-9e68-4c9c-a745-be061e2a95be
00:04:42.933 --> 00:04:44.766
principles of the guidelines
before.

5268d71b-e596-4942-a936-2db0e4a700c7
00:04:45.500 --> 00:04:47.466
I'll put in in the chat and

1480510b-33df-4b94-92d3-d5a2546e9697
00:04:48.300 --> 00:04:49.300
share that

021a6f2a-3aa2-4880-a631-1117ad42081d
00:04:49.966 --> 00:04:51.699
as soon as I copy it properly.

192e8cc8-e01c-4a80-b356-58d331c1c208
00:04:54.200 --> 00:04:58.000
[Matthew Deeprose] Awesome.
Thank you so much Terry.
Sharon, if I could turn

79892555-38a8-4084-968e-9a2ce7181233
00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:02.233
to you, do you have any tips and
strategies to appealing to all

5e544ddb-5ade-4621-a71f-831fcee5bc6d
00:05:02.233 --> 00:05:06.433
students in terms of alternative
formats?

523861b8-1091-461b-8287-4d0ecd5281c3
00:05:06.433 --> 00:05:09.166
And inclusive practise in general perhaps?

fa679e55-ff09-4973-ac30-f82b11656533
00:05:10.300 --> 00:05:16.366
[Sharon Austin] Sure. And I am certainly a big
fan of Ally and its ability to

1e76fae1-b773-45ba-9340-3e62bb5ecf1c
00:05:16.366 --> 00:05:18.999
build in UDL  practises.

7afd0cd9-bba5-48bc-a4ab-9d99c1abd1db
00:05:19.933 --> 00:05:24.766
But to honestly to get students
to use it, I appeal to their

bba03788-bf0a-4033-b2db-9b3d79f1cdf2
00:05:24.766 --> 00:05:29.832
selfish nature. I say look what
you know the BeeLine reader can

2018aea4-69ba-4c5f-a8e5-e22a5d0191d8
00:05:29.833 --> 00:05:34.666
do for you. You can put it in
different colours if you like,

51b4a5de-765a-49db-ad49-0816a3598240
00:05:34.666 --> 00:05:38.966
or I will point out the
Immersive Reader, so that they

ba9f1890-c9c2-426d-9c2b-68aa1a01abcf
00:05:38.966 --> 00:05:43.632
can listen to it at their
convenience rather than watch it.

55fdb4df-3d43-4581-9df7-74ae73093ad2
00:05:43.633 --> 00:05:47.766
So, appealing to personal
customization. It's a very

edc771c7-84dd-44f3-a60c-3a8ddf2d9403
00:05:47.766 --> 00:05:50.999
powerful tool to getting
students to use

614db21f-fc9f-46eb-a157-67feff9bdb4a
00:05:51.100 --> 00:05:55.233
alternative formats, even though
the teachers do it to make it

23a33194-4b08-4029-b054-ba67f57bbe7a
00:05:55.233 --> 00:05:58.099
multimodal, right?
Selfishness always wins.
