0a0905ee-5fdb-4821-a20a-13eafd51c426
00:00:06.033 --> 00:00:09.533
[Terry Greene] So, a win for us

bb24aef4-d0d2-42c2-bd07-380a2c17efb4
00:00:10.300 --> 00:00:12.333
in the kind of just

2cf42e66-bec4-431b-ba3d-4b3e8dc6df6a
00:00:13.300 --> 00:00:16.433
few months into the pandemic.
There's an organisation in

10d9edaf-df6e-41a3-b151-6f5b2300eded
00:00:16.433 --> 00:00:18.066
Ontario called eCampusOntario,

7a4d65e2-9af5-45da-bbcd-3a6024c0e4d0
00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:23.266
who is funded to help support
digital learning and

5ddf6a35-d868-4cc3-862d-cbbb3f0f6591
00:00:24.100 --> 00:00:29.033
they got a nice chunk of funding
to get us to create some virtual

2b4d8ac3-e729-4256-a46a-1c873d0a5d29
00:00:29.033 --> 00:00:32.466
learning strategy projects and
we created one

55ffd6c2-0350-427d-95d0-fb32604925c9
00:00:35.500 --> 00:00:39.333
for learners. The whole idea
is to help online learners

cc88897c-2d5a-4e7b-8697-a7c245107433
00:00:39.333 --> 00:00:41.033
become more independent and...

a5753bb0-0412-46a3-a7f8-253032ed4004
00:00:41.800 --> 00:00:45.733
so, it's called "The Liberated
Learner" and I'll put the thing

8729b84c-63e6-44bb-bbf8-df915fe34641
00:00:45.733 --> 00:00:49.533
in here. And specifically the
part here that I think is a win

c3c68592-2022-42bb-9d25-2740e8a0ae90
00:00:49.533 --> 00:00:53.399
for accessibility is there's a
module called "The Technologist".

c6554459-f2cb-40f5-8632-2adfa12a4017
00:00:53.400 --> 00:00:57.000
As in, you as a student can
become a technologist yourself

ce498166-7eaa-4e6e-8abf-49ebe2843f16
00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:58.000
and

2a8a88e0-3858-4e9c-ab5d-555016716065
00:00:59.133 --> 00:01:02.766
have skill in navigating
technology.

c076646f-4904-4501-af62-e1c31cdf5e9c
00:01:02.766 --> 00:01:06.832
And there's a section on podcasting
and a section on video

93fa66b5-59dc-4fc0-bf22-a0b55bd17633
00:01:07.166 --> 00:01:10.766
production that I really
think helps support UDL

cfef039b-993d-43d2-8261-414e6b8d5f63
00:01:10.766 --> 00:01:14.932
Universal Design for Learning in...
specifically in the multiple

b51fef42-d09e-4e0b-b76d-10ef73aa594e
00:01:14.933 --> 00:01:18.866
means of expression. So, if you
as an instructor want to give

2c03b164-a8c1-4e81-a781-7f63cef0f2fd
00:01:18.866 --> 00:01:23.232
the students the opportunity to
not just do an essay, if they

451421f5-f2a7-4ff1-9b8c-2a9758c4770f
00:01:23.233 --> 00:01:26.766
don't want, but to create a
podcast or a video instead,

29ac11c3-d5e9-445b-b6ba-e9f654d41d49
00:01:27.633 --> 00:01:31.133
it's a little scary sometimes
because YOU may not know how to

2dac2f21-25ee-4c20-83f7-a91acb57b400
00:01:31.133 --> 00:01:34.666
support the creation of those
yourself. So, enter this module.

17243a06-a0b4-439f-9638-54dcea844e65
00:01:34.666 --> 00:01:37.932
You can share it to your
students and say, "Hey, you wanna

b57389e5-3db7-440e-b650-290aba778da5
00:01:37.933 --> 00:01:41.633
do a podcast? Here's step by step
instructions for how to do that.

cc542102-de82-4eaf-8b32-15f138ee87bd
00:01:41.633 --> 00:01:45.099
Can't wait to see it..." kind of
thing. And the pressures on you

d259583c-2d95-43f0-b35d-6d49ef4dde69
00:01:45.100 --> 00:01:48.200
less to do that. So that's
that's what I would call an

e3b35bd2-ce48-4e1a-af25-876bc1395ede
00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:50.800
accessibility win for us.
And yeah, thank you.

3ceb6321-8783-419a-b714-88b7cf2bf64f
00:01:51.400 --> 00:01:54.700
[James Northridge] I guess
the other thing that's is a

f8c19909-852c-4ae7-998f-3a376481c2a6
00:01:54.700 --> 00:01:58.766
major success and I have to
say a hat tip to Matt. We...

dd3ea567-081f-45bc-a1f1-306a04a8ad7f
00:01:58.766 --> 00:01:59.966
Last summer we ran

a73937c9-db39-4774-bc44-f6bea86392a6
00:02:00.933 --> 00:02:04.299
what we, what Matt, calls the
Ally Interns. And so we brought

0f8c4e3d-1703-4b5f-a54f-de41d758987a
00:02:04.300 --> 00:02:07.466
in four interns last year,
student interns that worked with

b2c527f1-5fc4-458f-884a-60fd29496ae5
00:02:07.466 --> 00:02:10.866
us for ten weeks in the summer and
we took in twenty modules across the

61a8f74f-b4d4-44cb-976c-5780e639d98f
00:02:10.866 --> 00:02:13.966
university and we had the
students review those modules

a67fc4aa-ff49-4810-b966-5f374dbf69bf
00:02:13.966 --> 00:02:17.332
for accessibility and it was a
really, really good success.

63549394-33b7-460b-beda-4c235ad9930e
00:02:17.333 --> 00:02:20.433
And we saw that the scores
jumped quite high in terms of

a66aed6f-e991-44b1-a426-3f2ca84f73bc
00:02:20.433 --> 00:02:23.566
those twenty modules and
also we were building capacity

274e2a69-873e-4b1e-a5b1-b822e42386f6
00:02:23.566 --> 00:02:26.932
within those twenty staff.
So the instructors or staff that

8e30a32e-b0e4-4f7a-a171-34925ef47804
00:02:26.933 --> 00:02:29.999
ran those modules or courses
were then really brought into

7df4478f-debc-4df6-960d-b6fd0d011ce6
00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:33.466
that and we kind of brought them
on the journey. They had to meet

920fb33b-81d5-4450-8a6f-ac2bf79adacd
00:02:33.466 --> 00:02:34.066
the students every

c8a2ef10-844c-48b4-879f-9fd255eb5aa8
00:02:34.166 --> 00:02:37.232
two weeks and we did a showcase
back to the staff in terms of

62388f62-efbf-4279-9351-7c5581cb0af6
00:02:37.233 --> 00:02:40.266
what the students learned. But I
guess again the

7b4bb662-b00a-4be1-8200-b5fedeb8bb39
00:02:40.266 --> 00:02:41.632
positive that came from that

f6921030-213f-4aa7-af64-a4b3c47dbb8f
00:02:42.633 --> 00:02:46.399
was that this year, we just
we just interviewed on Monday

2a062cf9-5375-441f-b70e-d5feb41e26e4
00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:50.200
and Tuesday and we're taking on
18 (one eight), we're taking on

c86a8a57-0bb4-4b8a-bfd7-de0b83d86303
00:02:50.200 --> 00:02:53.766
18 students as of the 6th of
June this year for another

2ab02265-22e6-4511-a510-a427f608fc03
00:02:53.766 --> 00:02:57.432
10 weeks. And so we've really
ramped up that pilot

36447043-35ca-410f-b276-487181367fe8
00:02:57.433 --> 00:03:01.066
from last year and that's a...
we we have a phenomenal bunch of

441fe3e9-1215-4a01-b94c-b2561874e98b
00:03:01.066 --> 00:03:04.666
students that are coming in this
year with like really good

483d1083-e1c8-4289-bca3-778fbc4a9ed4
00:03:04.666 --> 00:03:08.132
experience of accessibility
which which I have to say I

4eb97474-c795-485f-beb6-3281ec5291a9
00:03:08.133 --> 00:03:11.366
was delighted to see. And we
just have this really

1e859021-505b-4ddb-ad20-648d54264340
00:03:11.366 --> 00:03:13.266
interesting group. We've had 100

d4cbcf1a-d7b5-4070-87ed-c56ae1cf3dfe
00:03:13.400 --> 00:03:16.633
and,  I checked us before we
came on here, we had 182 modules

e0724628-7376-4273-8bdb-cb76e7ec4607
00:03:16.633 --> 00:03:19.699
submitted for review. And so
again, it's expression of

c4052e64-834e-477c-a6b8-4e8314e8eb5f
00:03:19.700 --> 00:03:23.066
interest by staff and ideas that
staff are brought in to be part

fee748a8-2cce-4565-a827-f0012f2f5624
00:03:23.066 --> 00:03:26.232
of this and they have to
commit to meeting the students

14eccd10-e6d3-4d65-ab3f-3c7fe1a49060
00:03:26.233 --> 00:03:29.233
regularly, and they have to
commit to giving the students

24e362d0-1bc4-43ea-8a7c-f718ccaadbbf
00:03:29.233 --> 00:03:32.366
the support and ongoing
training. And what we'll do off

b809b842-fa43-44de-8374-7e75b4140bbd
00:03:32.366 --> 00:03:35.499
the back of those 18 students,
for next semesters, we'll

71643435-d532-408a-bc8f-9ce375a23cd5
00:03:35.500 --> 00:03:38.466
keep on four of them over
semester one and semester two to

c05c04ab-a5b8-47c1-b2b5-bc48335e7cb0
00:03:38.466 --> 00:03:41.766
sort of almost run our training
and a lot of the work that

3da5bcac-4ed7-4e16-aea9-7c9bcd0559bf
00:03:41.766 --> 00:03:44.266
we do over the summer will
inform the training

66180d45-cb0e-4803-aa6e-92137d3c25f3
00:03:44.366 --> 00:03:47.399
we develop for staff come
semester one. So that's that's a

000a46c8-463a-439b-867b-5a2b55b1a4cc
00:03:47.400 --> 00:03:50.600
big win for us and obviously was
a... I think in just to put a

f5944110-99b0-49de-b9d1-85efe7a55509
00:03:50.600 --> 00:03:53.933
financial figure on it. I think
it's costing us somewhere in the

5d353e82-e54b-46c2-ad34-8fda416c6499
00:03:53.933 --> 00:03:54.933
region of

57e258e7-2c53-459b-9209-6d03581eddff
00:03:55.500 --> 00:03:59.033
€60,000. Yeah, you know, it's,
it's, maybe 60, maybe

e69e1d75-112f-4a82-8d1a-26d17e9176aa
00:03:59.033 --> 00:04:02.666
€70,000 to bring that bunch of
students in. But I do, I'm very

a43fda1d-3def-40a3-a886-49206cffa3a9
00:04:02.666 --> 00:04:06.099
confident that we'll see big
results. So yeah, that's a big

db527002-5ec9-4a7b-b56d-150ad39e01fc
00:04:06.100 --> 00:04:07.100
win for us.

fd236a54-bdd2-4023-b265-35578c9a5382
00:04:07.900 --> 00:04:12.100
[Dr Tharindu Liyanagunawardena] The second one
I would liketo say is at University of Reading

30f08607-12f6-4fbb-a778-19b183a19bfa
00:04:12.100 --> 00:04:15.533
I did a workshop with
the creative team at the

e6cf0f0a-6845-4806-8e1e-793c63f2fd1a
00:04:15.533 --> 00:04:19.233
university. These are the
creative staff who create all

69252c12-88a9-4066-94f2-4a78a17f94dd
00:04:19.233 --> 00:04:24.033
the beautiful brochures, prospectus,
anything that look amazing.

071b90d4-5148-4eb4-b68b-99afccb8e85c
00:04:24.366 --> 00:04:27.399
However, these were not always
fully accessible.

899b5bd6-ef8b-4737-8484-81a350be3ddc
00:04:28.633 --> 00:04:33.966
I'm so pleased to say that all
actively engaged in this workshop.

f0fad910-378a-46de-8c3d-a7669a326cfc
00:04:34.566 --> 00:04:38.299
We are getting more than the
usual number of queries from the

f5bd37c0-e273-4e8f-8b84-37c5aecdf238
00:04:38.300 --> 00:04:42.233
creative team right now, but
this is because they are trying

386fe419-5d90-42f5-b35a-5420987d3145
00:04:42.233 --> 00:04:46.499
to incorporate the accessibility
into their designs and also into

4721856c-4730-4172-8258-146e0177c71b
00:04:46.500 --> 00:04:47.533
their practices.

448ce55f-d861-4357-9718-36f948c7c516
00:04:48.433 --> 00:04:52.366
Now, University of Reading
creative teams will produce not

4693754f-9398-40df-8c0a-574060f8af98
00:04:52.366 --> 00:04:57.332
just amazing looking content but
also amazing and accessible content.

30146c95-de99-4dc4-bd43-5c5c98b66f1c
00:04:57.333 --> 00:05:00.433
So I think this is a
really big win.

ae6e8f3c-18a9-4cd7-86dd-2b2768222368
00:05:00.533 --> 00:05:04.166
[Sarah Whittaker] Thank you. I have two,
one recent and one from last year.

f4cfd7ef-f5a1-4530-9e3f-e17cc3f57c66
00:05:04.166 --> 00:05:08.466
So last year we had the Ministry
of Education come in and mandate

3253f731-9239-4711-9123-711fa7951635
00:05:08.466 --> 00:05:12.066
actually that we provide
instructional design training to

bd5a9018-dea6-4e8b-b1da-bb8da758f194
00:05:12.066 --> 00:05:15.499
all of our system course team
leaders. Those are the people

7f0794fd-d083-4f88-ba1b-2cdf5ebcdebc
00:05:15.600 --> 00:05:19.600
who are developing the courses
in Blackboard for their division

3e8f4ff9-c0c8-45c2-bc18-572df60b1d32
00:05:19.600 --> 00:05:23.033
or for their specific courses.
So with that I snuck in

258b1d86-502d-4499-a475-abdf0dcbccc8
00:05:23.033 --> 00:05:26.966
accessibility design into the
corse. I didn't sneak in and made

0ff0ffa9-5dab-4070-b7ab-708b32e1fb8e
00:05:26.966 --> 00:05:30.732
it very clear that that's what
we were doing. And and we had

867c378f-19f9-48c7-a6ea-4da29ea3a826
00:05:30.733 --> 00:05:31.766
over 500 people

2d7de4ad-b313-46ff-8c2e-21153d8cdd45
00:05:31.766 --> 00:05:36.399
complete the course with me last
year and the majority of those

ce1b3b5f-1428-486d-bd2e-4d0d32ee8bec
00:05:36.400 --> 00:05:40.833
people were system course team
leaders and they learnt about

ddaa59b8-e5d0-4917-af64-9b8150d957ab
00:05:40.833 --> 00:05:45.533
colour contrast. And I went into
over 100 courses and I reviewed,

7ff33178-bdb4-4a4f-980c-d6b1b0f7e8df
00:05:45.533 --> 00:05:49.966
like you know, navigation, I
reviewed whether they're using

27aa12cf-53ca-4cf3-bc02-a0effa3eef78
00:05:49.966 --> 00:05:54.332
headings like their items and
then I built it into a really

0c3f3c69-4ec6-43d0-8d78-b9e242cf7d71
00:05:54.333 --> 00:05:58.966
fast-paced 2 hour workshop with
an applied knowledge assignment

2eafef78-8b79-4390-992f-7596a904147a
00:05:58.966 --> 00:06:02.932
afterwards. And they basically
had to redesign an item

4cf87ec3-aa80-4876-8263-a8727f6f5100
00:06:03.100 --> 00:06:06.866
and share it with us, like how
they would redesign it. And I'm

00:06:06.866 --> 00:06:10.499
happy to announce there's no
yellow on white font in any of

de0385d9-de2d-4698-aadd-c4bbab5183dd
00:06:10.500 --> 00:06:14.100
our courses anymore. People are
actually using the headers,

7f67fa6d-265a-4da5-aa3b-34ff0f44cb8d
00:06:14.100 --> 00:06:17.900
people are adding, adding the
alt description to their images.

00:06:17.900 --> 00:06:21.500
So it's a huge improvement from
what we were doing before.

00:06:21.500 --> 00:06:25.366
So, we do a lot of our course re-designs
during the next couple of

00:06:25.366 --> 00:06:29.799
months, actually in June, July.
So, last year it was a huge win for us.
