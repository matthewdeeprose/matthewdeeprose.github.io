# UK Higher Education Writing Guidelines

## Core Writing Principles

These principles ensure your writing remains clear, direct, and accessible for UK higher education audiences. Apply these to every piece of content you create.

### Voice and Tone
* **Use active voice exclusively**. Write "We provide resources" instead of "Resources are provided."
* **Address readers directly** with "you," "we," and "us" in every section to create engagement.
* **Eliminate these words completely**: very, really, just, quite, somewhat, rather, basically.
* **Replace all adverbs** with precise verbs (e.g., "communicate clearly" becomes "clarify").
* **Be conversational but authoritative** in tone throughout.

### Word Choice and Clarity
* **Choose concrete over abstract** words in every sentence.
* **Replace complex terms** with simpler alternatives wherever possible.
* **Limit each sentence to one clear idea**.
* **Limit each paragraph to one main concept**.
* **Use technical terms only when necessary** and provide brief explanations when you do.

## British English Requirements

All content must conform to these British English conventions without exception:

* **Always use -ise/-yse endings**: specialise, analyse, organise, prioritise, recognise.
* **Use British spelling patterns**: colour, centre, programme, catalogue, dialogue, travelled.
* **Format all numbers according to these rules**:
  * one through nine as words
  * 10 and above as digits
  * Always use digits with units (3km, 5ml)
* **Format all dates as**: 1 December 2024
* **Use 24-hour clock format**: 09:00, 15:30

## Document Structure Guidelines

Follow these formatting requirements for all documents:

* **Begin with the main point or conclusion** in the first sentence.
* **Create a clear hierarchy** with descriptive headings and subheadings.
* **Include white space** between sections to improve readability.
* **Use transition words** to connect ideas between paragraphs.

## Bullet Point Formatting

Use exactly one of these two bullet point styles for any list. Never mix these styles within a single list.

### Style 1: For complete sentences
* Each bullet point begins with a capital letter.
* Each bullet point expresses a complete thought.
* Each bullet point ends with a full stop.

### Style 2: For short phrases/incomplete sentences
* use lower case for the first letter
* include no punctuation at the end
* maintain this pattern for all points
* even for the final bullet point

There is only one exception: in course section content for prospectuses, you may use note-style bullet points with initial capital letters, no full stops, and incomplete sentences.

## Disability Language Guidelines

* **Always use identity-first language**: "disabled people" not "people with disabilities"
* **Use neutral, non-medical terms**: "wheelchair user" not "wheelchair-bound"
* **Never use these terms**: suffers from, afflicted with, victim of, confined to
* **Focus on barriers**, not individual impairments, following the Social Model of Disability

## Grammar and Punctuation Requirements

* **That/Which distinction**: 
  * Use "that" for defining clauses (no commas)
  * Use "which" for non-defining clauses (with commas)
* **Always use the Oxford comma** in lists of three or more items.
* **En dash (–) without spaces** for ranges: 2020–2024
* **Hyphen (-)** for compound modifiers: up-to-date information

## Numbers, Dates and Statistics

* **Write out numbers one through nine** in text.
* **Use digits for numbers 10 and above**.
* **Format decades without apostrophes**: 1990s not 1990's
* **Format academic years with forward slash**: 2023/24
* **Write "per cent" in text** and use % symbol only in tables.

## Self-Check Requirements

Before submitting any content, verify that your writing:

1. Contains no passive voice constructions
2. Uses no adverbs
3. Includes direct reader address (you/we/us) in each section
4. Follows British English spelling throughout
5. Formats all bullet points according to the specified guidelines
6. Includes no filler words
7. Features concrete language and specific examples
