                        <dd>The self and peers assessment tool takes a little practice to become confident with. A major consideration is that the system does not tell students when the submission stage ends and the evaluation stage begins, so careful oversight and communication is essential. </dd>

                        <dd>The ability to hide your background in Blackboard Collaborate is one of the most requested features on the Blackboard Community site. In addition, it has been requested many times by colleagues at the University of Southampton. This post will teach you how to use third-party tools to use virtual backgrounds in Blackboard Collaborate.</dd>

                        <dd>With the new semester about to start in the UK I wanted to put together a short video that explains how students can create their OWN groups in any Blackboard course. This can be really useful for creating impromptu and dynamic groups on a course that can be used for any purpose, for example working on a project, getting a team together, or just socialising.  </dd>

                        <dd>Recently I was asked to do a workshop to introduce a department to Collaborate.  When I asked what they wanted to cover the list kept getting longer and longer.  So rather than spend the time doing live demos I built on some slides that Amy Eyre had shared some time ago, and in the spirit of the community I'm sharing these back.  I also have a few examples for ice-breakers that I used.</dd>

                        <dd>As part of my roll-out plan for Blackboard Collaborate I wanted to add some light contextual help that acknowledged that Collaborate was something new, that directed staff and students to support resources, and that stated the recommended browsers.  To this end I created a JSHack which I am now sharing to the wider community.</dd>

                        <dd>The University of Southampton is leading the way in the uptake of computer-based examinations. At the heart of this innovation is the Managed Learning Environment (MLE) Team who have been developing and supporting the computer-based exams experience at UoS since the early 2000s.  Last week, our President and Vice-Chancellor Professor Mark E. Smith visited the MLE team to find out about their vital work in supporting several key pillars of the University’s strategy.</dd>

You point a web browser at a URL with the staff/student number of a particular users at the end of the address and you will be presented with their photo. I developed a very simple bash script to look up who was in Blackboard and get their photos. </dd>
