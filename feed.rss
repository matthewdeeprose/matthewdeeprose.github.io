      <description><![CDATA[Recent experiences have demonstrated that University staff and students expect to use online resources with a variety of devices, making full use of accessibility features such as reflow, captions, and text-to-speech.

Such features benefit everyone, but especially the increasing proportion of university students who self-report a disability.

University Information Technology departments know they must commit to accessibility; indeed, they have a legal obligation to do so, but how can they take this ambition and embed accessibility within their policies and processes?

In this presentation, we will share:

approaches to building a digital accessibility policy for university IT departments.
techniques for embedding accessibility within IT development processes by ‘shifting left’.
examples from within the Higher Education and wider IT sectors.]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[The University of Southampton introduced Blackboard Ally (a tool that provides insight into an institution's accessibility) in Summer 2021. To support the rollout, five student interns were employed over the summer as “Accessibility Allies”.

In this webinar, the University's Digital Learning Team shared how they organised the project and provided information about the work undertaken by the students and outlined how they achieved impressive results.

Students were involved with remediating course content to make it more digitally accessible, and advised academic staff about how to improve accessibility, among other things. Their work resulted in an average 87% increase in course file accessibility score, benefiting more than 6,000 students.]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[IT departments in the Higher Education sector and elsewhere know they must commit to accessibility, but how can we take this ambition and embed it within our operations?

Within the University of Southampton IT department (which is named iSolutions) senior leadership committed to delivering "amazing accessibility" but has not yet set out how this might happen.

In this internal presentation within the department, held on Global Accessibility Awareness Day on 20 May 2021, I attempt to show how we could start that journey.]]></description>
